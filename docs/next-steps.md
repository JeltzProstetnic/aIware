# Next Steps — Action Plan

Last updated: 2026-02-13

## IMMEDIATE (before submission)

### 1. Register ORCID
- Go to https://orcid.org and register (free, 2 minutes)
- Required by NoC at submission
- Add to paper-noc.md header and cover letter

### 2. Consider ASSC membership
- Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness
- 20% discount on NoC APC: $2,364 → $1,891 (saves $473)
- Check if membership fee makes the discount worthwhile
- Also: networking value, conference access, credibility signal

### 3. Send outreach emails — Wave 1
- **Shriki** (shrikio@bgu.ac.il) — most aligned, ConCrit author
- **Hengen** (khengen@wustl.edu) — criticality meta-analysis
- Attach The_Four_Model_Theory_of_Consciousness.pdf
- Best arXiv endorsement prospects

### 4. Send outreach emails — Wave 2 (1 week after wave 1)
- **Metzinger** (metzinger@uni-mainz.de) — Self-Model Theory (no endorsement ask, emeritus)
- **Carhart-Harris** (robin.carhart-harris@ucsf.edu) — psychedelic prediction testing
- **Priesemann** (viola.priesemann@ds.mpg.de) — criticality empirical work

### 5. arXiv preprint
- Depends on endorsement from email responses
- Endorsement link: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=E9JU9T
- Category: q-bio.NC
- **Submit arXiv BEFORE journal** (65% citation boost per studies)
- Need to sync arxiv/paper.tex with paper-noc.md trimming

### 6. Submit to NoC
- Portal: https://academic.oup.com/nc
- Use paper-noc.md (convert to appropriate format — Word/LaTeX)
- Include cover-letter-noc.md
- Article type: Review Article
- Expect ~6 week review turnaround

## MEDIUM-TERM (weeks after submission)

### 7. Sync arxiv/paper.tex with trimmed paper
- The LaTeX version needs the same cuts as paper-noc.md
- This is the arXiv submission file

### 8. Online presence / discoverability
- **ResearchGate profile** — create account, upload preprint
- **Google Scholar profile** — will auto-populate after arXiv/NoC
- **ORCID profile** — link publications
- **LinkedIn post** — already written (pop-sci/linkedin-post.md), post after arXiv/NoC submission

### 9. Popular science outreach
- **Aeon / Nautilus query letter** — pitch based on magazine-article.md
- **Blog post or personal website** — accessible summary for non-specialists
- **Video/podcast scripts** — already polished (pop-sci/), could pursue production

### 10. Git repo cleanup
- Email files removed from tracking (done this session)
- Consider cleaning git history if emails are in past commits (BFG Repo Cleaner)
- Update README.md with links to published paper once available

## LONGER-TERM

### 11. Respond to peer review
- Prepare for likely objections: epiphenomenalism, lack of formalization, independent researcher status
- ConCrit (Algom & Shriki) convergence is strongest defense

### 12. Backup journal plan
- If NoC rejects: **Consciousness and Cognition** (Elsevier) → **Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience**
- Paper-noc.md works for C&C too (similar word limits)
- Frontiers has higher acceptance rate, lower prestige

### 13. AC architecture design (Roadmap Step 7)
- After publication: begin designing the artificial consciousness architecture
- Four-model architecture at criticality — engineering specification
- This is the "ultimate prediction" made concrete

### 14. Mathematical formalization
- Collaborate with computational neuroscientists (potential outcome of Shriki/Hengen outreach)
- Use ConCrit's tools (power-law exponents, branching parameters)
- Would strengthen the theory significantly and could be a follow-up paper
