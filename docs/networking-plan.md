## Tier 1: Direct Theoretical Overlap (Contact First)

| Researcher | Affiliation | Why | Approach |
|-----------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **Oren Shriki** (+ Inbal Algom) | Ben-Gurion University, Dept. Cognitive & Brain Sciences | ConCrit framework (2026) = criticality as unifying mechanism for consciousness. Paper already cites them in abstract. They have the "what" (criticality), we provide the "why" (simulation requires it). | Email Shriki (corresponding author). Lead with citation, explain convergence, propose discussion. |
| **Keith Hengen** (+ Woodrow Shew) | WashU Biology / U Arkansas Physics | 140-dataset criticality meta-analysis (Neuron 2025). Paper cites them. Independent confirmation of P5. Hengen frames criticality as "unified theory of the mind." Active public communicator (TEDx). | Email, highlight independent convergence from Wolfram 2015 vs their empirical synthesis 2025. |
| **Thomas Metzinger** | U Mainz (emeritus) | SMT is explicit ancestor of Four-Model Theory. German. Co-authored AI welfare paper (Long et al., 2024). Strongest possible endorser. | Email in German. Cite lineage. His Ego Tunnel → our ESM. |
| **Michael Graziano** | Princeton | AST overlaps with self-model mechanism. | Email, highlight differences in self-model scope. |

### Why ConCrit Authors Specifically
- ConCrit frames criticality as *unifying mechanistic framework* — same direction as our theory but from opposite starting point (mechanism-first vs theory-first)
- They address same altered states (anesthesia, psychedelics, sleep)
- They lack what we have: a theory of *why* criticality matters (our answer: simulation requires it for rich experience)
- Mid-career lab at Ben-Gurion, not Harvard/MIT — likely more receptive to independent researchers
- Paper: "The ConCrit Framework: Critical Brain Dynamics as a Unifying Mechanistic Framework for Theories of Consciousness" — Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, Jan 2026

### Why Hengen/Shew Specifically
- "Is criticality a unified setpoint of brain function?" — Neuron, Aug 2025
- 140 datasets, 2003-2024. Resolved methodological controversy.
- Hengen quote: "Brains need to reach criticality to think, remember and learn"
- Connects criticality to sleep, learning, Alzheimer's — domains where our theory predicts
- Active communicator: TEDx, The Transmitter podcast, WashU Ampersand features

## Tier 2: Empirical Prediction Partners

| Researcher | Affiliation | Relevant Prediction | Approach |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Robin Carhart-Harris** | UCSF | P2 (psychedelic content maps hierarchy), P3 (ego dissolution controllable), P4 (psychedelics alleviate anosognosia) | Email. P3 is a cheap experiment his lab could run immediately. Potential co-authorship. |
| **Lucia Melloni** | Max Planck / COGITATE | Theory testing, adversarial collaboration | Email. Volunteer theory for adversarial testing. |
| **Viola Priesemann** | Max Planck Göttingen | Criticality dynamics, P5 | Email. Cite P5 convergence. German — can write in German. |
| **Marcello Massimini** | U Milan | PCI / criticality measures, P5 | Email. PCI work directly relevant to criticality requirement. |

## Tier 3: AI Consciousness Community

| Researcher | Affiliation | Why | Approach |
|-----------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **Patrick Butlin** | Google DeepMind | Lead author on AI consciousness indicators (Butlin et al., 2023/2025) | Email. P7 gives concrete architectural requirements. |
| **Susan Schneider** | Cornell | *Artificial You* — AC architecture | Email. |
| **Jonathan Birch** | LSE | "AI Consciousness: A Centrist Manifesto" | Email. |
| **Anthropic Model Welfare team** | Anthropic | Directly relevant to P7 (substrate independence) | Email. |

Our theory gives concrete architectural requirements for AC — exactly what the AI consciousness debate is missing.

## Tier 4: Sympathetic Philosophers

| Researcher | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **Keith Frankish** | Illusionism compatible with virtual qualia account |
| **Philip Goff** | Would disagree (panpsychist) but active public debater — engagement = visibility |
| **Eric Schwitzgebel** | Wrote AI consciousness survey paper, open-minded |

## Conference Targets

| Conference | When | Where | Deadline | Status |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| **TSC 2026** | Apr 6-11 | Tucson | Nov 15, 2025 | MISSED — check late poster option |
| **ASSC 29** | Jun 30 - Jul 3 | Santiago, Chile | Open now | **SUBMIT** |
| **ASSC satellite** (neurophenomenology) | Jul 4-5 | Santiago | **Feb 28, 2026** | 15 days — consider submitting |

### ASSC 29 Notes
- THE consciousness-specific conference. Everyone in Tier 1-2 likely attends.
- Submit for poster or contributed talk.
- Website: https://theassc.org/assc-29/submissions/

### ASSC Satellite Workshop
- Commemorates 30 years of Varela's neurophenomenology paper
- Topics: first-person/neurobiological data integration, structured experiential methods
- Our theory's treatment of phenomenology (simulation = where experience happens) could fit
- Also: SAGE Adaptive Behavior special issue on neurophenomenology, deadline May 1, 2026
- Contact: info@neurophenomenology-assc2026.cl

## Channel Strategy

1. **arXiv** — Post on q-bio.NC first. Standard "I'm serious" signal. All emails should include arXiv link.
2. **Email** — Short, specific. Lead with why *their* work is relevant to *ours*. Don't attach paper; link to arXiv.
3. **LinkedIn** — Post already drafted (pop-sci/linkedin-post.md). Post after arXiv goes live.
4. **ResearchGate** — Create profile, upload preprint. Consciousness researchers actively use RG.
5. **Twitter/X** — Tag specific researchers. Active accounts: Anil Seth, Michael Graziano, Keith Frankish, Patrick Butlin.
