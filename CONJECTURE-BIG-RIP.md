# Conjecture: Class 4 Self-Containment Favors the Big Rip

*An open conjecture arising from the [SB-HC4A cosmological model](paper/cosmology/sb-hc4a.pdf). Not yet integrated into the paper — recorded here as a structural argument that may strengthen or redirect the cyclic cosmology analysis.*

## The Observation

[Paper 3](paper/cosmology/sb-hc4a.pdf) (Section 2.5) establishes that Class 4 automata contain all classes as subprocesses — including themselves. A universal computer can simulate another universal computer (Cook, 2004). This self-containment is unique to Class 4: no lower class can nest an instance of itself within its own dynamics.

The cosmology paper currently treats all three cosmological endgames — heat death, Big Crunch, and Big Rip — as compatible with the SB-HC4A framework (Section 10). Each drives the computational domain to Bekenstein saturation and triggers cyclic renewal. But self-containment may break this symmetry.

## The Argument

Class 4 self-containment is **proliferative**: the architecture generates autonomous Class 4 subsystems nested within itself. Which endgame is structurally consistent with a proliferative dynamics?

### Against Heat Death

Heat death is convergence toward thermodynamic equilibrium — effectively Class 1 (static, dead). But Class 4 dynamics are self-maintaining via self-organized criticality (Bak et al., 1987). SOC *generates* gradients; it drives the system away from equilibrium, not toward it.

There is also a physical problem. If particles are computational atoms — stable Planck-scale singularity configurations (Paper 3, Section 5) — then heat death requires all singularities to dissolve uniformly. Protons would have to decay. Proton decay is unconfirmed; the current experimental lower bound exceeds 10^34 years. More fundamentally: in a framework where singularities are information boundaries at Bekenstein saturation, "uniform dissolution" is difficult to make physical sense of. Information boundaries don't fade — they transform.

### Against Big Crunch

The Big Crunch is convergence to a single point. All singularities at every scale — Planck, particle, stellar, cosmological — must converge without gaps. But the self-similar nesting of Class 4 within Class 4 means there is structure at every scale resisting compression. Singularity boundaries exist between every nested computational domain. For clean convergence, all these nested layers would need to collapse simultaneously and uniformly — an increasingly implausible requirement as the nesting depth increases.

### For Big Rip

The Big Rip (Caldwell, 2002) fragments spacetime into multiple independent domains. Each fragment reaches Bekenstein saturation independently and restarts as an autonomous Class 4 automaton. Paper 3 (Section 10.3) already notes that the Big Rip uniquely produces "a branching tree of daughter universes rather than a linear successor."

Self-containment provides a *reason* for this preference: the Big Rip is what Class 4 self-nesting looks like at cosmological scale. The parent automaton literally fragments into daughter automata — each one Class 4, each one capable of further self-nesting. Phantom dark energy (w < -1) would be the physical mechanism by which the universe's computational architecture expresses its proliferative tendency.

## Strength Assessment

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **As a structural preference** | Strong — Big Rip is most consistent with proliferative self-containment |
| **As a necessity argument** | Weaker — cannot rule out other endgames from self-containment alone |
| **Testable** | Yes — predicts w < -1 (phantom dark energy) |
| **Current data** | w ~ -1 (cosmological constant favored; DESI 2024 hints at evolution but inconclusive) |

## Status

This is a conjecture, not a derivation. It may eventually be integrated into Paper 3 (Section 10, cyclic cosmology) as a structural preference argument, or it may be refined into a stronger claim if the physical arguments about singularity dissolution and convergence can be formalized.
