## Key Finding

**No major scholarly paper explicitly argues that the systematic exclusion of motivation from intelligence models is a fundamental theoretical blind spot.** This confirms the novelty of our paper.

## Summary Table

| Theory | Acknowledges Motivation? | Includes in Model? | Why Not? |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Binet (1905) | Yes (affects test performance) | No | Designed tests to minimize motivational variance |
| Spearman (1904) | Implicit (g as "mental energy") | No | Factor analysis strips out motivational variance |
| Wechsler (1940) | **Yes (essential for life success)** | **No (called for it, ignored)** | Psychometric tradition prevailed |
| Cattell (1943-1987) | Yes (investment traits motivate Gf->Gc) | No | Treats motivation as external catalyst |
| CHC Theory (dominant) | Yes (acknowledged as confound) | No | Pure cognitive model, 16 abilities, zero motivational |
| Sternberg (1985) | Implicit (practical intelligence) | No | Not theorized as distinct component |
| Gardner (1983) | **Yes (intrapersonal intelligence)** | **Yes** | Rejected by field, lacks psychometric validation |
| Ackerman PPIK (1996) | Yes (personality & interests drive development) | No | Kept outside intelligence construct |
| Dweck (2006) | Yes (growth mindset drives development) | No | Treated as educational psychology, not intelligence |
| Stanovich (2016) | **Yes (motivation to engage System 2)** | **No (part of RQ, not IQ)** | Preserves traditional IQ construct |
| Duckworth (2007) | Yes (grit = perseverance + passion) | No | Personality trait, orthogonal to IQ |

## Closest Predecessors

1. **Wechsler (1943)**: "We cannot expect to measure total intelligence until our tests also include some measures of the non-intellective factors." — Ignored.
2. **Snow (1996)**: Proposed SRL as "overarching conative concept" — stayed in educational psychology.
3. **Stanovich (2016)**: Introduced RQ to capture what IQ misses — kept as separate construct.
