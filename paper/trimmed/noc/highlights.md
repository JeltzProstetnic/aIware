# Highlights

- Consciousness is constituted by real-time self-simulation across four nested models (implicit/explicit × world/self); qualia are virtual — they exist within the simulation, not in the physical substrate — dissolving the Hard Problem by revealing a category error.

- The theory simultaneously addresses all eight core requirements for a complete theory of consciousness (Hard Problem, Explanatory Gap, Boundary, Structure, Binding, Combination, Causal Role, Meta-Problem), a benchmark no existing theory meets.

- Five derived principles (criticality, virtual qualia, redirectable self-model, variable permeability, virtual model forking) unify psychedelic phenomenology, anesthetic mechanisms, dreams, split-brain phenomena, and dissociative identity disorder under a single framework.

- The criticality requirement, derived theoretically from Wolfram's computational framework in 2015, converges with the empirical neural criticality literature consolidated in 2025–2026 — a decade-apart convergence from independent starting points.

- Nine novel testable predictions are offered, including that psychedelic ego dissolution content is controllable via sensory input and that psychedelics should alleviate anosognosia — predictions few competing theories generate.
