# Figure Alt Text for NoC Submission

## Figure 1: The Four-Model Architecture

**Alt Text:**

A conceptual diagram showing four nested models arranged in a 2x2 grid. The vertical axis represents mode (implicit learned at bottom, explicit simulated at top) and the horizontal axis represents scope (everything/world on left, self only on right). The top-left box labeled "Implicit World Model (IWM)" in light blue contains bullet points: synaptic weights, all learned knowledge, causal models, perceptual regularities, motor programs. The top-right box labeled "Implicit Self Model (ISM)" in light green contains: body schema, habits/personality, autobiographical memory, motor skills, social self-knowledge. Both implicit boxes are labeled "REAL SIDE: Non-conscious, lights off" on the right margin. A horizontal orange dashed line labeled "IMPLICIT-EXPLICIT PERMEABILITY BOUNDARY" separates the implicit models from the explicit models. The bottom-left box labeled "Explicit World Model (EWM)" in light blue contains: the conscious world, sensory experience, perceived reality, colors/sounds/textures, spatial structure, and a sub-label "VIRTUAL QUALIA". The bottom-right box labeled "Explicit Self Model (ESM)" in light tan/beige contains: the conscious self—"I", subjective perspective, sense of agency, redirectable (ego dissolution), forkable (DID), with a dashed circle icon labeled "self-referential closure". Both explicit boxes are labeled "VIRTUAL SIDE: Phenomenal, lights on" on the right margin. Blue arrows labeled "generates" flow from IWM to EWM and from ISM to ESM. A gray arrow labeled "Sensory input" enters from the left into the EWM. A legend at the bottom shows the arrow types and the permeability boundary representation.

## Figure 2: The Real/Virtual Split

**Alt Text:**

A diagram showing two large circles side by side representing distinct ontological domains. The left circle in blue is labeled "Virtual, simulated, explicit" at the top and contains two rounded rectangles: "Explicit World Model (EWM)" and "Explicit Self Model (ESM)" with "Simulation" written in italic blue text between them. Below the circle is the text "Lights on, phenomenal experience". The right circle in gray is labeled "Real, learned, implicit" at the top and contains two rounded rectangles: "Implicit World Model (IWM)" and "Implicit Self Model (ISM)". Below the circle is the text "Lights off, no phenomenal character". Blue arrows labeled "generates" connect from IWM to EWM and from ISM to ESM, crossing from the real side to the virtual side. At the bottom center, a gray rounded rectangle labeled "Real World (external environment)" has a solid brown arrow labeled "learning" pointing up into the real/implicit circle and a dashed gray arrow labeled "sensory input" pointing up into the virtual/explicit circle. A yellow text box at the bottom spans the width of the diagram stating: "Key Insight: The Hard Problem dissolves at the real/virtual boundary. The substrate (real side) does not experience. The simulation (virtual side) does. Asking why neurons 'feel' commits a category error—neurons generate the simulation; the simulation feels."

## Figure 3: Phenomenological Content Through a Morning

**Alt Text:**

A line graph showing the variation of phenomenological content over time during a typical morning. The x-axis represents time with labeled events: "Alarm goes off; must get up!", "Ready, time to go", "Driving to work (routine)", "Threat—full attention" (marked in red), "At work, nothing special", "Social salience spike" (marked in orange), and "Settled at desk, routine resumes". The y-axis is labeled "Phenomenological content". The line in blue with light blue shading beneath traces a wavy pattern with several peaks and troughs. The first peak corresponds to the alarm, followed by a smaller peak at "Ready, time to go", then a trough during routine driving. The highest peak (marked with a red dashed vertical line and labeled "Speed trap!") occurs at the threat moment. After returning to baseline at work, a second moderate peak (marked with an orange dashed vertical line and labeled "Attractive colleague") occurs at the social salience moment, followed by a final decline as routine resumes. A blue horizontal bar below the x-axis spans the entire timeline labeled "conscious". A gray text box at the bottom states: "ESM updates produce peaks in phenomenological content. Routine activities → low content (autopilot). Salient events (threats, social signals) → high content. Consciousness tracks what matters, not everything."

## Usage Instructions

These alt text descriptions are formatted for direct entry into the ScholarOne manuscript submission system. Each description should be pasted into the "Alternative Text" or "Accessibility Description" field when uploading the corresponding figure.

The descriptions provide:
- Visual structure (layout, shapes, colors)
- Key labels and text content
- Relationships shown by arrows and spatial arrangement
- Sufficient detail for a screen reader user to understand the figure's content without seeing the image

Do not include the figure captions themselves in the alt text field—those are entered separately in ScholarOne's caption field.
