# Intelligence Paper — Next Journal Target

**Paper**: "Why Intelligence Models Must Include Motivation: A Recursive Framework" (7,858 words, theoretical, no data)
**Rejection history**: NIdP (desk reject <24h), Philosophical Psychology (desk reject <2 days)

## Comparison

| | Theory & Psychology | Frontiers in Psychology | Cognitive Systems Research |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Publisher** | Sage | Frontiers Media | Elsevier |
| **Scope fit** | Excellent — theoretical psychology is its whole purpose | Good — Theoretical & Philosophical Psychology section | Good — interdisciplinary, but leans computational |
| **Cost to publish** | Free | CHF 3,150 (~EUR 3,350) APC | Free |
| **Impact Factor** | 1.9 | 3.27 | 2.4 |
| **Quartile** | Q1 (SCImago) / Q3 (WoS) | Q2 | Q2 |
| **Word limit** | 10,000 (incl. refs) | 12,000 | No stated cap |
| **Review type** | Double-blind | Open/collaborative | Standard peer review |
| **Time to decision** | ~2–3 months | ~6 weeks (desk) / ~3 months (full) | ~3 months |
| **Desk reject risk** | Low — theoretical papers are the core content | Low — high acceptance rate (~37%) | Moderate — may want computational angle |
| **Red flags** | None | 2025 retraction scandal (53 papers); grey-zone reputation; expensive | Declining IF (was 5.9 in 2021) |

## Verdict

**Theory & Psychology is the clear winner.**

- Free to submit AND publish (no APC)
- The journal literally exists for theoretical psychology papers — lowest desk-rejection risk
- Sage is an unambiguous, respected publisher
- IF 1.9 is modest but appropriate for a theoretical paper
- Fast turnaround (~2–3 months)
- Double-blind peer review

**Frontiers** has a higher IF (3.27) but costs CHF 3,150 and has ongoing reputation issues. Not worth the money for a "last attempt" paper.

**Cognitive Systems Research** is free but leans computational and has a declining IF. Decent backup if T&P also rejects.
