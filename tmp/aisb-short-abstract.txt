========================================================================

The ethical status of artificial minds depends on whether we can determine,
in principle, if an artificial system is conscious. I present the Four-Model
Theory (FMT), a substrate-independent framework that makes this question
empirically tractable.

FMT holds that consciousness is constituted by real-time self-simulation
across two kinds of models along two axes: scope (world vs. self) and mode
(implicit/learned vs. explicit/simulated). The resulting 2x2 matrix of
model kinds — not four discrete modules — defines the minimum modeling
capacity any conscious system must possess. The theory's central claim is
that qualia are virtual: they exist within the self-simulation, not at the
substrate level, dissolving the Hard Problem by revealing a category error
in its formulation. A physical prerequisite — the substrate must operate at
criticality (edge of chaos) — provides a testable condition derived
independently from Wolfram's computational framework (2015) and convergent
with empirical criticality literature (Hengen & Shew, 2025; Algom & Shriki,
2026).

For artificial consciousness, FMT specifies concrete requirements: persistent
learned models of world and self, real-time simulation, self-referential
closure, and criticality. Current LLMs fail on all counts. The theory
predicts graduated consciousness levels, suggesting AC would emerge along a
continuum rather than as a binary threshold. Ethically, this provides a
testable criterion for moral status — avoiding both overcautious panpsychism
and dismissive functionalism — and implies that ethical obligations scale
with the depth of self-simulation. FMT transforms the question from "might
AI be conscious?" to "are we building the architecture that would make it
conscious?" — a question amenable to empirical investigation and responsible
governance. Nine testable predictions are offered, several directly relevant
to artificial substrates.
