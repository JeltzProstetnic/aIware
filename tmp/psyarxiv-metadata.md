### Abstract

The science of consciousness remains in a pre-paradigm state, with no theory simultaneously satisfying the eight core requirements a complete theory must meet: the Hard Problem, the Explanatory Gap, the Boundary Problem, the Structure of Experience, Unity and Binding, Combination and Emergence, the Causal Role, and the Meta-Problem. I present the Four-Model Theory, in which consciousness is constituted by real-time self-simulation across four nested models arranged along two axes—scope (world vs. self) and mode (implicit vs. explicit). The implicit models (Implicit World Model, Implicit Self Model) are substrate-level, learned, and non-conscious. The explicit models (Explicit World Model, Explicit Self Model) are virtual, transient, and phenomenal—they are the simulation in which experience occurs. The theory's central claim is that qualia are virtual: they are the way the simulated self perceives its own states within the simulation, not properties of the physical substrate. This dissolves the Hard Problem by showing that "Why does physical processing feel like something?" commits a category error—the physical processing does not feel; the simulation does, and within the simulation, qualia are constitutive. Combined with a criticality requirement (the substrate must operate at the edge of chaos), the theory derives diverse phenomena from five principles: criticality, virtual qualia, a redirectable Explicit Self Model, variable implicit–explicit permeability, and virtual model forking. These principles unify psychedelic phenomenology, anesthetic mechanisms, dream states, split-brain phenomena, dissociative identity disorder, and animal consciousness. A systematic comparison shows the theory addresses all eight requirements. Nine novel testable predictions are offered, including that psychedelic ego dissolution content is controllable via sensory input and that psychedelics should alleviate anosognosia—predictions few competing theories generate. The criticality requirement, derived from Wolfram's computational framework in 2015 independently of the empirical criticality program, converges with empirical criticality literature consolidated in 2025–2026—a decade-apart convergence from theoretical and empirical starting points.

### Abstract

Intelligence research has produced a paradox: the field widely acknowledges that motivation influences cognitive development, yet virtually every major model of intelligence formally excludes it. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) taxonomy, the dominant psychometric framework, contains no motivational component. Cattell's own investment theory treats motivation as an external condition rather than a constitutive element. Sternberg's triarchic theory incorporates practical intelligence but not the drive to acquire it. This paper argues that this exclusion is not merely an oversight but a systematic blind spot that distorts our understanding of intelligence in three specific ways. First, it mischaracterizes intelligence as a static trait rather than a recursive, self-reinforcing system in which knowledge, cognitive performance, and motivation form a closed amplification loop. Second, it renders invisible the role of operational knowledge—learning strategies, logical tools, and strategic thinking—which functions as the primary multiplier within this loop. Third, it leaves the field unable to explain why current artificial intelligence systems, which possess vast knowledge and computational performance but no intrinsic motivation, fail to exhibit the self-directed development that characterizes human intelligence. This paper proposes a three-component recursive model (Knowledge × Performance × Motivation) and argues that intelligence is best understood not as a capacity but as a learning ability—one whose trajectory is determined by the dynamics of this recursive loop rather than by any single component measured in isolation.
