Subject: Your principal bundle geometry paper — and the "which systems?" question

Dear Dr. Kanai,

I wrote to you last week about independent convergence between your Information Generation Theory and my Four-Model Theory (FMT). I want to follow up with something more specific — your preprint with Oizumi and Lim on principal bundle geometry of qualia.

Your framework provides what I believe is the most rigorous structural characterization of qualia geometry to date. The rigid/plastic duality — orbit geometry inherited from the symmetry group vs. learned quotient space — maps directly onto the implicit/explicit architecture in FMT. What you call rigid orbit geometry corresponds to what I call the Implicit World Model (evolutionarily scaffolded prior structure); the plastic quotient space corresponds to the Explicit World Model (learned, individually shaped simulation of the world).

The two frameworks are complementary in a precise sense. Your paper characterizes the *shape* of qualia — their relational geometry within and across modalities. FMT addresses the prior question your paper explicitly leaves open: *why does the geometry feel like anything at all?* The answer FMT proposes — phenomenal character is a property of self-referential simulation, not of the physical substrate — could in principle apply to any system instantiating the equivariant geometry you describe.

This leads to what I see as the most productive bridge between our work. Your framework applies to any G-equivariant network, including non-conscious ones. An image classifier learns equivariant representations but presumably has no qualia. FMT's self-referential closure condition (the system must model its own modeling) and criticality requirement provide a principled criterion for narrowing "any equivariant network" to "the equivariant networks that are conscious." This is the discriminating condition your geometric framework currently lacks.

I believe there is a genuine research opportunity here: your geometry + FMT's boundary conditions = a framework that says both *what qualia are structured like* and *which systems have them.*

The preprints are unchanged from my previous email:
- Consciousness paper: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18669891
- Intelligence paper: https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg

I would be glad to discuss this further — even briefly.

Best regards,
