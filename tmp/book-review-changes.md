## Category A: Simple Text Corrections (Applied This Session)

These are direct wording improvements applied immediately to the canonical `.md`.

### A1 — Preface (L45): Soften "hardest" claim
- **Old**: "dissolves the hardest open problem in science"
- **New**: "dissolves one of the hardest open problems in science"
- **Rationale**: More accurate — other hard problems exist (mathematics, etc.)

### A2 — Preface (L49): Remove redundant "in English"
- **Old**: "shorter, in English, without the technical apparatus"
- **New**: "shorter, without the technical apparatus"
- **Rationale**: The book is already in English; stating it here is redundant

### A3 — About Author (L61): Restructure credentials
- **Old**: "I don't have a PhD. I'm not affiliated with any university. I've never held a research position, never received a grant, never been part of a lab."
- **New**: "I'm not affiliated with any university. I don't even have a PhD, only a master in bio-informatics. I've never received a grant, never been part of a neuroscience lab."
- **Rationale**: More honest and specific — mentions actual degree, specifies "neuroscience" lab

### A4 — About Author (L67): Remove self-deprecation about arithmetic
- **Old**: "Not with arithmetic — arithmetic is boring — but with the real thing"
- **New**: 'Not with arithmetic but with the "real" thing'
- **Rationale**: "arithmetic is boring" is dismissive; the quote marks on "real" add nuance

### A5 — About Author (L75): Space → Spacetime
- **Old**: "What is space? What are the rules?"
- **New**: "What is spacetime? What are the rules?"
- **Rationale**: More precise physics terminology

### A6 — About Author (L117): LLM context + "and" instead of "or"
- **Old**: "humanity was not ready for sentient robots. They would enslave them, or use them for a world war"
- **New**: "humanity was not ready for sentient robots (we didn't even have LLMs at that time). They would enslave them, and use them for a world war"
- **Rationale**: Historical context (pre-LLM era); "and" implies both outcomes, not either/or

### A7 — About Author (L123): "available in English"
- **Old**: "It's shorter, in English, aimed at a broader audience"
- **New**: "It's shorter, available in English, aimed at a broader audience"
- **Rationale**: Book exists in German too; "available in" is more accurate

### A8 — About Author (L127): Tone down claims
- **Old**: "Whether the theory is correct [...] a demonstration of the kind of intelligence"
- **New**: "Whether the theory is good [...] a demonstration of a component of intelligence"
- **Rationale**: "good" is more modest than "correct"; "a component of" is more precise

### A9 — About Author (L129): Word choice
- **Old**: "an unusual range of fields"
- **New**: "an unusually wide range of fields"
- **Rationale**: Slightly more natural phrasing

### A10 — Chapter 1 (L183): Soften universalist claim
- **Old**: "they're all looking for consciousness in the wrong place"
- **New**: "most people are looking for consciousness in the wrong place"
- **Rationale**: "all" is too absolute — some researchers do look in the right place

### A11 — Chapter 1 (L191): "most" → "many"
- **Old**: "constraints that most consciousness theories either ignore or violate"
- **New**: "constraints that many consciousness theories either ignore or violate"
- **Rationale**: Softer, more defensible claim

### A12 — Chapter 1 (L197): You → We (Copernican Principle)
- **Old**: "You are not special [...] *you* aren't special. Your consciousness is not a unique miracle"
- **New**: "We are not special [...] *we* aren't special. Consciousness is not a unique miracle"
- **Rationale**: Inclusive "we" is more appropriate — the author is not exempt

### A13 — Chapter 2 (L287): "permanent" → "relatively rigid"
- **Old**: "permanent (until it's modified by learning)"
- **New**: "relatively rigid (adapted by learning)"
- **Rationale**: More accurate — "permanent" contradicts the parenthetical

### A14 — Chapter 2 (L337): "that reptiles lack" → "most reptiles"
- **Old**: "the capacity for self-modeling that reptiles lack"
- **New**: "the capacity for self-modeling that most reptiles lack"
- **Rationale**: Some reptiles may have limited self-modeling; hedge the claim

### A15 — Chapter 5 (L539): "good" → "works"
- **Old**: "the one that really convinced me the theory is good"
- **New**: "the one that really convinced me the theory works"
- **Rationale**: "works" is more precise — it's about explanatory power, not quality

### A16 — Chapter 6 (L665): Simplify alcohol reference
- **Old**: "Cocaine, methamphetamine, and chronic alcohol use"
- **New**: "Cocaine, methamphetamine, and alcohol"
- **Rationale**: "chronic" is already implied by context; simplify

### A17 — Chapter 6 (L689): Replace salvia danger description
- **Old**: "you stop knowing where your body is and what 'falling' means"
- **New**: "you stop knowing where your body is and may fully believe you have wings and can fly"
- **Rationale**: More vivid and based on personal experience; better illustrates the danger

### A18 — Chapter 6 (L697): Add dissociation qualifier
- **Old**: "(but not lethal) dose of Salvinorin A"
- **New**: "(but not lethal and not completely dissociating) dose of Salvinorin A"
- **Rationale**: Complete dissociation would prevent the thought experiment from working

### A19 — Chapter 12 (L1175): Less timid about timeline
- **Old**: "Not next year, probably not this decade. The engineering challenges are enormous."
- **New**: "The engineering challenges are not to be underestimated."
- **Rationale**: Removes unnecessary self-limiting timeline prediction

### A20 — Chapter 13 (L1251): "preferable to death" addition
- **Old**: "Maybe it's tolerable, the way moving to a new country"
- **New**: "Maybe it's tolerable for some, preferable to death, the way moving to a new country"
- **Rationale**: Adds the pragmatic perspective — imperfect transfer may still beat dying

### A21 — Chapter 14 (L1329): "worse" → "dramatic"
- **Old**: "The second time was worse."
- **New**: "The second time was dramatic."
- **Rationale**: It was dramatic but not necessarily subjectively "worse" than the first

### A22 — Chapter 14 (L1343): Clock analogy — Swiss people
- **Old**: "why evolution produced clock faces — it didn't, separately. It produced clocks."
- **New**: "why the Swiss people produced clock faces — they didn't, separately. They produced clocks."
- **Rationale**: More concrete and witty; evolution is abstract, Swiss clockmaking is tangible

### A23 — Chapter 14 (L1365): Add "or to what degree"
- **Old**: "**Are the implicit models virtual too?**"
- **New**: "**Are the implicit models virtual too?** (or to what degree)"
- **Rationale**: Reframes from binary to spectrum question

### A24 — Chapter 14 (L1383): "claim" → "idea"
- **Old**: "the most speculative claim in this book"
- **New**: "the most speculative idea in this book"
- **Rationale**: "idea" is less loaded than "claim"; it's exploratory, not asserted

---

## Category B: Content Additions (Simple — Applied This Session)

These are personal experience corrections or small additions integrated immediately.

### B26 — Chapter 6 (~L681): "Felt like being dead"
- **Addition**: New line after the salvia proprioceptive takeover description
- **Content**: Integrate "it also felt like being dead" into the personal experience narrative
- **Context**: Enhances the first-person salvia account

### B28 — Chapter 7 (L743): Sleepwalking memory correction
- **Old**: "I could see I'd also walked along the walls in a large circle, over and over, displacing objects and wearing patterns into the carpet. I remembered none of it. The substrate was navigating, motor programs were executing, but the simulation — the 'I' — was dark."
- **New**: "I remembered that I'd walked along the walls in a circle trying to go out, not finding the door. The substrate was navigating, motor programs were executing, but the simulation — the 'I' — was dark during the phase in which I sat down at my desk and tried to write down what had happened."
- **Rationale**: Author correcting his own memory — more accurate personal account

### B29 — Chapter 13 (L1247): "or dead" feeling
- **Old**: "feels... wrong. Profoundly"
- **New**: "feels... wrong — or simply dead. Profoundly"
- **Rationale**: Adds the extreme case — total substrate loss might feel like death, not just wrongness

### B31 — Acknowledgments (L1416): Uncle Norbert Gruber
- **Addition**: New acknowledgment entry
- **Content**: Uncle Norbert Gruber — one of the first IT professionals in the Rheintal, gave Matthias his first PC. Deceased.
- **Note**: Needs proper wording integrated into acknowledgments section

---

## Category C: Complex Changes (Documented for Later Sessions)

These require research, new prose, structural decisions, or author discussion.

### C25 — About Author (L107): Medicine → Neurology motivation (NEEDS ENGLISH)
- **Author's note** (German): "ein Fach das ich ursprünglich wählte um Neurologie zu erforschen"
- **Translation**: "a subject I originally chose to study neurology"
- **Action needed**: Write English parenthetical explaining he chose medicine originally to pursue neurology research. Brief, one clause.

### C33 — About Author (L119): Metzinger's theory status (NEEDS RESEARCH)
- **Author's note**: "(what happened to Metzinger's theory in the meantime?)"
- **Action needed**: Research what happened to Thomas Metzinger's Self-Model Theory of Subjectivity (SMT) since ~2015. Did it gain traction? Get superseded? Still active? Write 1-2 sentences contextualizing.

### C34 — Chapter 1 (L141): Mathematics has harder problems (NEEDS DECISION)
- **Author's note** (German): "naja, in der Mathematik gibt es meiner Meinung nach härtere Probleme"
- **Translation**: "well, in my opinion there are harder problems in mathematics"
- **Action needed**: Decide whether to add a qualifier like "arguably" or a footnote. The "hardest problem" claim is already softened by A1, but this suggests further hedging.

### C35 — Chapter 1 (L187): Blind spot + field consensus (NEEDS NEW CONTENT)
- **Author's note**: "blind spot example here, this is a hard sell without a simple argument. also mention here already that the field actually agrees with this preposterous statement."
- **Action needed**: Write 2-3 sentences with the blind spot as concrete proof that we don't see reality directly, plus note that this is actually mainstream neuroscience/philosophy (cite relevant authorities). This strengthens a key early claim.

### C36 — Chapter 1 (L207): Fix transition "But first"
- **Author's note**: "(but first? before what? better Now its time...)"
- **Action needed**: Replace "But first, I need to show you the four models." with something like "Now it's time to look at the four models." Simple wording fix.

### C37 — Chapter 2 (L223): Forward reference to earlier point
- **Author's note**: "(as mentioned or something like this because we need to make this point earlier but it doesn't hurt to repeat it here)"
- **Action needed**: Add "As I mentioned earlier," or similar phrase before the paragraph about perception being a model. Also flag that the point about "you never see reality" should be introduced even earlier (perhaps in Chapter 1, where C35 adds the blind spot). Two-part fix: (1) add forward reference here, (2) ensure the claim appears earlier.

### C38 — Chapter 2 (L233): Replace figure + restructure explanation
- **Author's notes**: "NO use the bubble diagram here instead. the old book figures are not to be re-used in this book, they are ALL ugly." + "(but actually its just two models with sub models, we need to make sure this part is easy to understand!, digital twin analogy here?)"
- **Action needed**: (1) Replace figure reference with bubble diagram. (2) Restructure the four-models introduction — consider framing as two models (world + self) each with implicit/explicit sub-models. (3) Consider digital twin analogy. Major structural rewrite of a key section.

### C39 — Chapter 2 (L295): Connectome reference
- **Author's note**: "(however, other scientists are already working on the foundation for this: the connectome)"
- **Action needed**: Add 1-2 sentences about connectome research (e.g., Human Connectome Project) as the beginning of mapping the real side. Brief, factual.

### C40 — Chapter 2 (L341): Birds as alternative architecture
- **Author's note**: "mention birds here also!"
- **Action needed**: Add birds (corvids, parrots) as another alternative architecture alongside octopuses. Mention their nuclear-organized pallium vs. mammalian layered cortex.

### C41 — Chapter 5 (L609): "Interesting" contradicts "boring"
- **Author's note**: "(interesting and boring contradict. keep 'the boring one' but change the first part of the sentence.)"
- **Action needed**: Reword to remove "Interesting, well-supported" — replace with something like "Well-established, thoroughly documented, and — forgive me — the boring one."

### C42 — Chapter 5 (L611): d'Hooft and holographic universe question
- **Author's note**: "(if this IS how quantum entanglement works, it means that a simple ruleset produces our holographic universe in d'Hooft's sense, right?)"
- **Action needed**: Decide whether to incorporate this as a parenthetical or footnote. It's a connection to Gerard 't Hooft's cellular automaton interpretation of quantum mechanics. Could be a powerful addition but needs careful phrasing.

### C43 — Chapter 5 (L613): Minor text addition
- **Old**: "Not a system that merely *runs on* a holographic substrate."
- **New**: "Not a system that merely *runs on* a holographic substrate (or produces a hologram)."
- **Action needed**: Simple insertion — could be applied now, but grouped with C42 since they're in the same paragraph.

### C44 — Chapter 6 (L663): Lucid dreaming appendix
- **Author's note**: "(put lucid dreaming manual in separate appendix)"
- **Action needed**: Write a new Appendix D with practical lucid dreaming techniques. This is a significant content addition requiring research into standard techniques (reality checks, MILD, WILD, etc.).

### C45 — Chapter 8 (L895): Split-brain = two persons argument
- **Author's note** (long parenthetical): Argues that split-brain patients are closer to two persons than one, especially if bandwidth between hemispheres is insufficient for real-time synchronization. Notes they cooperate well due to shared body/inputs.
- **Action needed**: Expand into a proper paragraph. This is an important theoretical claim that needs careful writing. Should acknowledge the philosophical debate (Parfit, Nagel) and connect to the four-model framework.

### C46 — Chapter 10 (L969): Expand learning definition
- **Author's note**: "(and adaptation, and allowing us to act against learned behavior)"
- **Action needed**: Integrate into the sentence about what consciousness enables. Add adaptation and the ability to override learned behavior (counter-instinctual action) as key functions.

### C47 — Chapter 11 (L1163): LLM-breaking prompt experiment
- **Author's note**: "maybe we can design a prompt that 'breaks' LLMs like this? and prove thereby that llms are not conscious?"
- **Action needed**: **Experiment first, then decide.** Design a self-referential loop prompt that would trap a purely sequential processor but that a conscious being resolves via meta-cognition. Test against current LLMs. If it works, incorporate results. High-value but needs experimental validation before book inclusion.

### C48 — Chapter 13 (L1191): Continuity value argument (stroke/amnesia)
- **Author's note**: "(however, a stroke patient or an amnesia patient might argue that personal continuity is still of value even in an altered way, still better than death)"
- **Action needed**: Write a paragraph about how imperfect continuity can still be valuable. Reference stroke survivors and amnesia patients who maintain identity despite significant cognitive changes. The "better than death" argument is pragmatically important.

### C49 — Chapter 13 (L1193): Virtual-level-only copy
- **Author's note**: "(except if you find a way to copy the virtual level perfectly and replace the implicit/physical level with a good alternative system, see better than death argument above)"
- **Action needed**: Write about the theoretical possibility of copying only the virtual models (EWM + ESM) and running them on a different substrate. This connects to the distinction between substrate and simulation. Careful treatment needed.

### C50 — Chapter 13 (L1199): Brain "programming language" decoding
- **Author's note**: "(except if we manage to decode the programming language the brain uses to create the virtual systems, then we could read and recompile them digitally, on a symbolic, code level)"
- **Action needed**: Write about the possibility of reverse-engineering the neural "code" — reading the brain's programming language and recompiling for digital hardware. This is speculative but connects to computational neuroscience efforts. Needs careful framing as future possibility.

### C51 — Chapter 13 (L1227): Major meditation on copy problem (LARGE)
- **Author's note** (extended): Questions whether sleep already interrupts simulation (weakening the copy objection). Reflects on personal knockout/amnesia experience — "existing is more important than remembering." Argues "we are all the same basically" — being born isn't traumatic despite having no prior continuity. The real problem is putting a model from one body into a different body/system, but moving only virtual models could solve that.
- **Action needed**: This is substantial new content — potentially a new subsection in Chapter 13. Needs careful integration of: (1) sleep as daily simulation interruption, (2) personal knockout experience as evidence, (3) philosophical argument about identity at birth, (4) virtual-model-only transfer as solution. Major writing task.

### C52 — Chapter 13 (L1255): "Depending how it is done"
- **Author's note**: "(depending how it is done)"
- **Action needed**: Brief qualifier about instant transfer risks being method-dependent. 1-2 sentences.

### C53 — Chapter 13 (L1259): Bobiverse reference
- **Author's note**: "(link to the bobiverse scifi books!)"
- **Action needed**: Add footnote referencing Dennis E. Taylor's "Bobiverse" series (*We Are Legion (We Are Bob)*, 2016) as a science fiction exploration of the consciousness-copying problem.

### C54 — Chapter 6 (L693): Expanded salvia experience (MEDIUM)
- **Author's note**: Expands the salvia time dilation account with: (1) "including wings and flying around" during the sequence, (2) "(the flying feeling came from the air rushing by while I fell back on the bed)", (3) chronology fix: "a few years earlier (1998/99)" for the NDE, (4) "(if I remember correctly, the person who first synthesized salvinorin A and experimented with large doses reported living through a whole lifetime, decades not years, during the about 20 minutes the substance can bind)"
- **Action needed**: Rewrite the salvia time dilation paragraph integrating these personal details and the note about salvinorin A synthesizer's experience (needs verification — likely Daniel Siebert or the Ortega group). Check chronology of NDE vs salvia experience.

### C55 — Chapter 14 (L1347): Cosmic argument expansions
- **Author's note**: Added "possibly scale" to dimensions list, changed "guarantees" to "almost guarantees it (if infinite at least in some dimensions)", added speculation: "because nothing cannot exist and is just a platonic idea"
- **Action needed**: Integrate carefully. The "nothing cannot exist" idea is philosophically substantive (related to Parmenides, Leibniz's "why is there something rather than nothing?"). Needs proper framing — perhaps a footnote or clearly marked speculation.

### C56 — Appendix A (L1506): Francis Crick / Christof Koch NCC reference
- **Author's note**: "link to francis crick and robert kochs book about the NCC, which is wrong in its quest but the best treatise of functional neuroanatomy I have read"
- **Action needed**: Add reference. Likely means Christof Koch (not Robert Koch the bacteriologist). Most probable book: Christof Koch, *The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach* (2004). Or Francis Crick, *The Astonishing Hypothesis* (1994). Need to confirm with Matthias which book exactly.
