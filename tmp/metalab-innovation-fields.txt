FIELD 1: Describe your innovation in one sentence.
----------------------------------------------------

A 2×2 factorial fMRI design that tests whether consciousness decomposes along two orthogonal dimensions — scope (world vs. self) and mode (implicit vs. explicit) — generating a double dissociation prediction that no current theory of consciousness makes.

Current theories of consciousness — GNW, IIT, HOT — each capture aspects of conscious processing but generate overlapping, often indistinguishable predictions. The COGITATE adversarial collaboration (2025) demonstrated this problem: neither GNW nor IIT fully accounted for the data. What the field lacks is a framework that generates genuinely novel predictions — ones that discriminate not just between two theories but across the entire landscape.

The Four-Model Theory (FMT) provides such predictions. FMT proposes that conscious processing is organized along two orthogonal dimensions: scope (world-directed vs. self-directed content) and mode (implicit/learned substrate vs. explicit/simulated phenomenal content). This 2×2 structure yields four model kinds — not discrete modules, but functionally distinguishable processing regimes. The key innovation is that this dimensional structure generates a specific empirical signature no competing theory predicts: a double dissociation.

The experiment: participants perform tasks requiring (a) world-directed perception, (b) self-directed introspection, (c) implicit perceptual learning, and (d) explicit metacognitive judgment, in a fully crossed 2×2 factorial fMRI design. FMT predicts:

- A main effect of scope: world-directed processing engages posterior sensory and parietal networks; self-directed processing engages medial prefrontal and default-mode regions.
- A main effect of mode: explicit (conscious, reportable) processing shows greater activation in prefrontal monitoring regions and higher metacognitive sensitivity (measured via confidence calibration) than implicit processing.
- Critically, an interaction: the transition from implicit to explicit mode produces qualitatively different neural signatures for world-content versus self-content, reflecting different simulation demands. World-model explicitation recruits perceptual simulation circuits; self-model explicitation recruits narrative and autobiographical circuits.

This double dissociation is not predicted by GNW, IIT, or HOT. The 2×2 structure is FMT's unique contribution.

Putting it into practice at the summer school: I would workshop the experimental design with metacognition researchers to (1) refine the task battery — ensuring clean separation of the four conditions, (2) specify the contrast analysis and ROI predictions in sufficient detail for pre-registration, and (3) identify which existing datasets (e.g., from COGITATE or metacognition studies) might already contain the relevant conditions for a preliminary test. The goal is to leave the summer school with a pre-registerable protocol ready for adversarial evaluation.

This connects directly to the school's themes: it bridges metacognition (the explicit self-model monitoring its own states) with consciousness (the transition from implicit to explicit processing), and it offers a concrete innovation — a new experimental paradigm — rather than a theoretical argument alone.
