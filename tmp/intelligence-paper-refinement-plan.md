**8 of 10 must-cite references are missing.** Here is exactly where each should go:

### 1. van Geert (2020) -- WHERE: New subsection in Section 3.4 ("Relation to Existing Work") + Section 7.1

**Argument supported**: The recursive model is not ad hoc -- it aligns with an established process ontology in developmental science. Van Geert provides the philosophical grounding: intelligence, personality, and self-esteem "must be given a strictly processual interpretation." The paper currently frames the recursive model against psychometric tradition but lacks an explicit ally in the dynamic systems literature.

**Specific insertion**: In Section 3.4, after the paragraph on Snow's cognitive-conative-affective framework (current ending: "was never integrated into mainstream intelligence theory"), add a new paragraph:

> "The dynamic systems approach to development provides deeper theoretical support. Van Geert (2020) argues from a process ontology that constructs like intelligence must be understood as 'temporary process stabilities' rather than fixed traits -- a position that directly underwrites the recursive model proposed here. What the present framework adds to van Geert's process ontology is specificity: it identifies the three components of the process (Knowledge, Performance, Motivation) and their recursive interaction as the mechanism generating the 'temporary stability' that psychometrics measures as IQ."

### 2. Macnamara & Burgoyne (2023) -- WHERE: Section 6.1 (Motivation is substantially learnable)

**Argument supported**: The paper currently cites Dweck (2006) and Yeager & Dweck (2012) uncritically when arguing that motivation is learnable through growth mindset interventions. The Macnamara & Burgoyne meta-analysis (d = 0.05, nonsignificant after correction; financial incentive bias in pro-mindset researchers) demands a more nuanced treatment. Crucially, this *strengthens* rather than weakens the paper's argument: growth mindset interventions fail because they treat motivation as an add-on belief change rather than as an integral component of the recursive loop.

**Specific insertion**: In Section 6.1, after the sentence citing Yeager & Dweck (2012) ("These beliefs are teachable"), add:

> "However, the empirical record is more complex than the initial enthusiasm suggested. Macnamara and Burgoyne (2023), in a comprehensive meta-analysis, found that growth mindset interventions produced negligible effects on academic achievement (d = 0.05 after correction for publication bias), with independent researchers finding significantly smaller effects than researchers with financial ties to mindset theory. This is consistent with the recursive model: changing beliefs about intelligence (a narrow sub-component of Motivation) without simultaneously addressing Knowledge and operational Knowledge cannot restart the recursive loop. The failure of mindset interventions, far from undermining the importance of motivation, illustrates what happens when motivation is treated as an add-on rather than as a constitutive component of a recursive system."

### 3. Bratsberg & Rogeberg (2018) -- WHERE: New material in Section 3.3 or a new subsection in Section 7

**Argument supported**: The Flynn effect reversal is direct evidence that intelligence is a process, not a fixed trait. If intelligence were primarily biological/genetic, population-level declines would not occur within a single generation. The Norwegian data (IQ rising from 99.5 in 1962 to 102.3 in 1975, then declining to 99.4 by 1989) demonstrate environmental causation.

**Specific insertion**: In Section 3.3 ("Why This Is Not Simply 'Motivation Matters'"), after the paragraph about predictions regarding self-reinforcing dynamics, add:

> "Population-level evidence supports this process view. Bratsberg and Rogeberg (2018), analyzing Norwegian military conscript data, demonstrated that IQ scores rose and then declined across birth cohorts within families -- ruling out genetic explanations and confirming environmental causation. The Flynn effect reversal, now documented across multiple countries, is incompatible with models that treat intelligence as a primarily biological trait. It is, however, precisely what a recursive model predicts: when environmental conditions that support the loop (educational quality, intellectual engagement) degrade, the loop weakens at the population level."

### 4. Canivez & Youngstrom (2019) -- WHERE: Section 2.1 (The CHC Taxonomy)

**Argument supported**: The paper's critique of CHC currently relies on McGrew (2009) and Schneider & McGrew (2018) -- sources that present CHC favorably. Canivez & Youngstrom provide ammunition from within the psychometric community: Carroll and Horn had "irreconcilable disagreement" about g, CFA fit statistics for the WJ-IV are poor, and incremental validity is weak.

**Specific insertion**: At the end of Section 2.1, after the sentence about motivation being treated as a confound, add:

> "The CHC framework's internal coherence has also been questioned on its own terms. Canivez and Youngstrom (2019) documented that Carroll and Horn held irreconcilable positions on the status of g, that confirmatory factor analyses of CHC-based test batteries show poor fit, and that the broad stratum abilities provide weak incremental validity beyond g. These internal difficulties suggest that the CHC taxonomy may be less settled than its widespread adoption implies -- and that the systematic exclusion of motivational variables may be contributing to its interpretive limitations."

### 5. Gignac & Zajenkowski (2024) -- WHERE: Section 3.3 (new material after Bratsberg & Rogeberg)

**Argument supported**: The Austrian paradox -- IQ scores rising while g (general intelligence) declines -- is devastating evidence against static-trait models and direct support for the recursive loop. It shows that teaching to the test can raise performance scores without improving the underlying recursive process. This is exactly what the recursive model predicts when only the Knowledge component (test-specific knowledge) is targeted without Motivation or operational Knowledge.

**Specific insertion**: Immediately after the Bratsberg & Rogeberg paragraph:

> "Even more striking is the 'Austrian paradox' reported by Gignac and Zajenkowski (2024): between 2005 and 2018, Austrian IQ scores rose while g -- the general factor extracted from the correlation matrix -- simultaneously declined. This dissociation is inexplicable under static-trait models but directly predicted by the recursive framework. Teaching to the test inflates Performance scores (narrow task-specific knowledge) without engaging the recursive loop. The result is higher scores on standardized measures with lower capacity for the self-directed, generalizable learning that the recursive loop produces. IQ goes up; intelligence, properly understood, goes down."

### 6. Balboni et al. (2021) -- WHERE: Section 3.4 (Relation to Existing Work)

**Argument supported**: Balboni et al.'s "adaptive intelligence" framework (intelligence = Person x Task x Situation) explicitly rejects intelligence as a personal trait. This is a natural ally for the recursive model.

**Specific insertion**: In Section 3.4, after the new van Geert paragraph:

> "Balboni et al. (2021) have similarly argued that intelligence is not a personal trait but an emergent property of the interaction between person, task, and situation. Their 'adaptive intelligence' framework complements the recursive model proposed here: the person brings Knowledge, Performance, and Motivation; the task and situation determine which components are activated and how the loop iterates. What the recursive model adds is the temporal dimension -- the developmental dynamics by which these interactions compound over the lifespan."

### 7. Sternberg (2021) -- WHERE: Section 2.3 or Section 3.4

**Argument supported**: Sternberg's "meta-intelligence" concept (intelligence operating on itself) is structurally recursive and represents the closest existing ally in the mainstream literature. The paper already cites Sternberg (2019) on adaptive intelligence; adding Sternberg (2021) on meta-intelligence strengthens the case that the field is moving toward the recursive view without having fully articulated it.

**Specific insertion**: In Section 3.4, after the existing Sternberg (2019) citation:

> "More recently, Sternberg (2021) proposed the concept of 'meta-intelligence' -- intelligence that operates on itself, recursively improving its own functioning. This is structurally identical to the recursive loop proposed here, though Sternberg does not formally integrate motivation into the recursive structure or specify the Knowledge-Performance-Motivation triad as its components."

### 8. Hilger et al. (2020) -- WHERE: Section 7.3 (Limitations) or Section 7.1

**Argument supported**: Neuroscience evidence that intelligence arises from the brain's dynamic ability to reconfigure network topology. This provides neural-level support for the process view: intelligence is not a fixed wiring pattern but a dynamic reconfiguration capacity.

**Specific insertion**: In Section 7.1 ("Relation to Established Intelligence Models"):

> "At the neural level, Hilger et al. (2020) have shown that intelligence is associated not with a fixed brain network topology but with the brain's dynamic ability to reconfigure its network architecture in response to task demands. This neural-level finding parallels the recursive model's claim at the psychological level: intelligence is a dynamic process, not a static capacity."

### 9. Duckworth et al. (2019) -- WHERE: Section 2.6 or Section 3.4

Note: The paper already cites Duckworth et al. (2007) on grit. The 2019 reference (cognitive vs. noncognitive predictors, Cambridge Handbook chapter) is a different work. It should be added to reinforce the general pattern of acknowledging noncognitive factors but keeping them outside intelligence.

**Specific insertion**: In Section 2.6 ("The General Pattern"), add to the list of disciplinary-boundary observations:

> "Duckworth and Datu (2019), in their Cambridge Handbook chapter on 'Intelligence and Motivation,' exemplify the pattern: they review extensive evidence of interaction between the two constructs but frame them as ontologically separate, never questioning whether the separation itself is the problem."

## B. Arguments to STRENGTHEN (with new evidence)

### Priority 1: Flynn effect reversal as evidence for intelligence-as-process (Section 3.3)

The paper currently argues that intelligence is recursive and self-reinforcing, but the evidence cited is primarily cross-sectional (Matthew effect, Gf-Gc divergence). The Flynn effect reversal (Bratsberg & Rogeberg, 2018) and the Austrian paradox (Gignac & Zajenkowski, 2024) provide *population-level longitudinal* evidence that intelligence responds to environmental conditions -- exactly what a process model predicts and a static-trait model cannot explain. These are the strongest two additions.

**Estimated word cost**: ~250 words (two paragraphs as drafted above)

### Priority 2: Growth mindset replication crisis as evidence that motivation-as-add-on fails (Section 6.1)

The paper currently treats Dweck's growth mindset work as straightforwardly supportive ("These beliefs are teachable"). The Macnamara & Burgoyne (2023) meta-analysis requires qualification. But the qualification actually *strengthens* the recursive model: mindset interventions fail because they target beliefs (a narrow sub-component of Motivation) without addressing Knowledge or operational Knowledge. The recursive model explains the failure pattern.

**Estimated word cost**: ~150 words

### Priority 3: CHC internal limitations (Section 2.1)

Currently the CHC critique is entirely about what CHC *excludes* (motivation). Adding Canivez & Youngstrom's evidence that CHC has internal fit problems makes the critique more devastating: CHC not only excludes motivation, it does not even model the cognitive components it claims to model very well.

**Estimated word cost**: ~100 words

### Priority 4: Dynamic systems theory alignment (Section 3.4)

The paper's "Relation to Existing Work" section currently reviews Sternberg, Dweck, investment traits, Murayama, Ackerman, Duckworth, Stanovich, and Snow. It does NOT mention the dynamic systems / process ontology literature (van Geert, Balboni, Hilger). This is a significant gap because the recursive model IS a dynamic systems model, and failing to acknowledge the existing dynamic systems literature makes the paper look less well-situated.

**Estimated word cost**: ~250 words (van Geert + Balboni + Hilger paragraphs)

---

## C. Sections to ADD or EXPAND

### C1. NEW: Flynn Effect Reversal subsection (~300 words)

**Location**: Either expand Section 3.3 or create a new Section 3.5 titled "Population-Level Evidence: The Flynn Effect Reversal"

**Content**: Bratsberg & Rogeberg (2018) Norwegian data + Gignac & Zajenkowski (2024) Austrian paradox + Platt et al. (2023) US SAPA data. Frame as three converging lines of population-level evidence that intelligence responds to environmental conditions -- exactly as the recursive model predicts. The timing of the reversal (~2010, smartphone ubiquity) is consistent with the recursive model's prediction that attention fragmentation disrupts motivation, degrading the entire loop.

**Rationale**: This is the single strongest empirical argument the paper is currently missing. The literature review calls it "GOLD" and "SMOKING GUN FOR PROCESS VIEW." It belongs in the paper.

### C2. EXPAND: LLM Case Study (Section 5, ~200 words)

**Current state**: Section 5 is already the strongest section on the AI angle. However, it was written before the reasoning-model era (OpenAI o1/o3). The literature review notes that reasoning models "achieve math competition gold" yet still lack intrinsic motivation.

**What to add**: A brief paragraph noting that even the most capable reasoning models (as of 2025-2026) exhibit the predicted failure mode: they can solve competition-level problems when prompted but do not independently seek out problems, do not self-direct their learning, and require external scaffolding (prompts, RLHF reward signals) that functions as a surrogate for the absent motivation component. This strengthens the existing argument with current examples.

### C3. EXPAND: Dynamic Systems Allies (Section 3.4, ~250 words)

**Current state**: The paper's "Relation to Existing Work" section does not mention van Geert, Balboni, Hilger, or Muller (2025). These are the paper's natural theoretical allies.

**What to add**: A paragraph block acknowledging that the dynamic/processual turn in intelligence research provides the theoretical context for the recursive model. Van Geert's process ontology, Balboni's adaptive intelligence, and Hilger's network dynamics all point in the same direction. The recursive model's contribution is to specify the *content* of the process (the K-P-M triad) and identify motivation as the missing driver.

### C4. NOT RECOMMENDED: Van Geert process ontology as separate section

The literature review suggests van Geert's alignment is important enough for a separate section. I disagree -- it fits naturally into Section 3.4 as additional existing work. A separate section would over-inflate a supporting argument at the expense of the paper's own original contribution.

### C5. NOT RECOMMENDED: Author biography as case study

The paper-connections analysis suggests using the author's own recursive loop as a case study. While appropriate for *New Ideas in Psychology* in principle, this would consume significant word count (~500+ words) for anecdotal evidence. The word budget is better spent on the Flynn effect reversal and dynamic systems positioning, which provide population-level and theoretical-level support respectively.

## D. Self-Plagiarism Check

### The Mushroom Example

The consciousness paper (`paper.md` submitted to NoC) contains the full poisonous mushroom example as its primary illustration of cognitive vs. reinforcement learning (Section 4.2).

**Status in the intelligence paper**: The intelligence paper does NOT reproduce the mushroom example. In Section 3.2, it references the cognitive learning distinction as follows:

> "The recursive loop described here requires a specific cognitive capacity: cognitive learning -- the induction of general theories from particular observations -- as distinct from reinforcement learning. The distinction between cognitive learning and reinforcement learning, and the specific neural architecture that enables the former, is developed in Gruber (submitted)."

**Verdict: CLEAN.** The intelligence paper correctly cites the consciousness paper for the mechanism without reproducing the example. No self-plagiarism risk here. The paper-connections analysis's recommendation (Section 6.1: "do NOT reproduce the mushroom example at length") is already satisfied.

### Other Overlap Areas

- **Recursion/self-reference**: Used differently in each paper (self-modeling depth vs. K-P-M feedback). LOW risk.
- **Four-model architecture**: Referenced but not re-derived. LOW risk.
- **AI implications**: Different angles (conscious AI vs. intelligent AI). LOW risk.
- **Emergence**: Common concept, different applications. NO risk.

**Overall self-plagiarism risk: LOW.** No changes needed.
