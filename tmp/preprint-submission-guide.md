### Abstract (249 words)
I propose a cosmological model — the Singularity-Bounded Holographic Class 4 Automaton (SB-HC4A) — derived from the convergence of four independently motivated frameworks: a five-class computational taxonomy that refines Wolfram's (2002) classification by separating fractal from random dynamics, the Four-Model Theory of consciousness (FMT; Gruber, 2015, 2026a) which identifies self-referential simulation at criticality as the mechanism of phenomenal experience, a formal model-space framework for continuous modeling density (Gruber, 2026b), and 't Hooft's (1993, 2016) holographic automaton interpretation of quantum mechanics. The model proceeds by elimination: Classes 1–3 cannot sustain the universal computation the universe demonstrably supports; Class 5 (genuine randomness) makes physics fundamentally impossible; therefore the universe operates at Class 4 — the edge of chaos. Combined with the information-theoretic observation that singularities at every physical scale (Planck regime, particle interiors, event horizons, cosmological horizons, temporal endpoints) share the property of information impermeability and Bekenstein saturation, the model proposes that these singularities are structurally identical — scale-invariant instances of the same information boundary. The resulting architecture is a self-referential holographic Class 4 automaton bounded at every scale by singularity surfaces, where the observable interior is the "simulation" and the singularity boundary is the "substrate." All singularities — including temporal endpoints — are shown to be asymptotically unreachable from within the computational domain, strengthening the unification claim. Because singularities transform rather than destroy information, heat death constitutes a singularity transition that triggers cyclic renewal, with potential CPT signature alternation across cycles — connecting to Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology and Boyle and Turok's CPT-symmetric universe. All three cosmological endgames — heat death, Big Crunch, and Big Rip (Caldwell, 2002) — drive the computational domain to Bekenstein saturation, with the Big Rip uniquely producing a branching tree of daughter universes rather than a linear successor. This architecture is structurally identical to the FMT consciousness architecture, where implicit models (substrate) are separated from explicit models (simulation) by an information-opaque boundary. Consciousness is thus a local, scale-reduced instance of the same computational pattern the universe implements globally. Six weak points are identified, including the fundamental epistemological objection that Class 4 observers may be constitutionally incapable of determining whether this model describes the universe or merely the ceiling of their own computational capacity.

### Published Preprints by Same Author
1. **Consciousness Paper**
   - **DOI**: 10.5281/zenodo.18669891
   - **Platform**: Zenodo
   - **Title**: The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness: A simulation-based framework unifying the Hard Problem, binding, and altered states
   - **Connection**: The SB-HC4A cosmology paper demonstrates that consciousness and the universe share identical computational architecture (Section 7). The FMT provides the consciousness half of this structural symmetry.

2. **Intelligence Paper**
   - **URL**: https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg
   - **Platform**: PsyArXiv
   - **Title**: (Intelligence paper - exact title to be confirmed)
   - **Connection**: Extends the Four-Model Theory formalization referenced in the cosmology paper (Gruber, 2026b).

### Note on Relationship
The cosmology paper **stands independently** — it does not require readers to accept the consciousness theory. However, if both models are correct, consciousness becomes a predictable local instance of a universal computational pattern rather than a cosmic accident (Section 11.2).

## 4. Recommended Submission Order

1. **Zenodo first** (immediate publication, DOI assignment, no review delay)
   - Fastest route to citable preprint
   - Consistent with consciousness paper already on Zenodo
   - DOI can be referenced in SSRN submission

2. **SSRN PhysicsRN second** (broader interdisciplinary audience)
   - Can include Zenodo DOI in "Related Works" or abstract
   - Reaches different audience (economics of science, philosophy, interdisciplinary researchers)
   - Higher visibility in non-physics communities who might be interested in consciousness-cosmology connection

**Alternative**: Submit to both simultaneously if immediate dual-platform presence is desired.

### Notes
- All of these journals **accept preprints** (standard in physics)
- Preprint publication **does not prevent journal submission**
- Some journals (e.g., Frontiers, MDPI Entropy) have article processing charges (APCs) for open access
