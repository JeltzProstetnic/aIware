# Complete Guide to Submitting Your Consciousness Theory Paper to PsyArXiv and bioRxiv

## CRITICAL FINDING: Choose ONE Server Only

**You CANNOT post to both PsyArXiv and bioRxiv.** bioRxiv's policy explicitly states: "Manuscripts already present on other preprint servers will not be posted" and "posting to multiple preprint servers is strongly discouraged" due to fragmented metrics and reader confusion ([bioRxiv FAQ](https://www.biorxiv.org/about/FAQ)).

**RECOMMENDATION: Choose bioRxiv** for your consciousness theory paper because:
1. **Disciplinary fit**: Neuroscience is a primary category on bioRxiv with 84,573+ articles, including substantial consciousness research ([Neuroscience on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/neuroscience))
2. **Broader audience**: Life sciences and neuroscience researchers are your primary target
3. **PsyArXiv scope risk**: PsyArXiv requires submissions to be "scholarly psychology" ([About PsyArXiv](https://blog.psyarxiv.com/about-psyarxiv/)). While consciousness papers appear there, theoretical neuroscience may face moderation challenges if framed as neuroscience rather than psychology

## 1. Journal Policy Check: Neuroscience of Consciousness (OUP)

**✓ PREPRINTS ALLOWED DURING PEER REVIEW**

Oxford University Press permits preprints at all stages:
- Authors retain the right to post Author's Original Version (preprint) "anywhere at any time"
- Posting does not prevent journal submission
- **Required after acceptance**: Update preprint with published DOI and acknowledgment of acceptance ([OUP Author Self-Archiving Policy](https://academic.oup.com/pages/open-research/open-access/charges-licences-and-self-archiving/author-self-archiving-policy))

**Action**: Safe to proceed with preprint posting during NoC peer review.

## 2. bioRxiv Submission Process (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Create Account
- **URL**: https://submit.biorxiv.org/
- Click "Create a new account" ([Registration page](https://submit.biorxiv.org/submission/registration))
- Provide email address
- **No cost** for registration or submission ([bioRxiv submission guide](https://www.biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript))
- **ORCID integration**: You can link ORCID 0009-0005-9697-1665 during submission so preprint appears on your profile

### Step 2: Prepare Your Manuscript

**File format**: PDF required (main manuscript)
- Your existing PDF at `/home/jeltz/aIware/paper/full/arxiv/paper.pdf` is ready to use
- LaTeX source can be uploaded as supplementary material if desired
- Figures/tables can be embedded in PDF or submitted separately (JPEG, TIFF, EPS formats accepted)
- **5 GB file size limit** (your paper is well under this)

**Metadata to prepare**:
- Title (exact match to PDF)
- Author name: Matthias Gruber (must match PDF exactly)
- Author email: matthias@matthiasgruber.com
- ORCID: 0009-0005-9697-1665
- Abstract (must match PDF)
- **Subject category**: Select "Neuroscience" as primary category
- **Manuscript type**: "New Results" (for novel theoretical advances)
- **License**: Choose Creative Commons license (CC-BY 4.0 recommended to retain credit)

### Step 3: Upload and Submit

1. Log in to https://submit.biorxiv.org/
2. Click "Submit a new manuscript"
3. Upload PDF
4. Enter metadata (ensure author name/order matches PDF exactly)
5. Declare:
   - All authors consent to deposition (you're sole author)
   - No conflicts of interest
   - Work performed ethically
   - Any AI/LLM use (disclose if used for editing/translation)
6. Select Creative Commons license
7. Submit

### Step 4: Screening Process

- **Timeline**: 24-72 hours typical; may take longer over weekends/holidays ([bioRxiv screening info](https://connect.biorxiv.org/news/2022/06/13/screening_procedures))
- **Two-stage screening**:
  1. In-house staff check completeness and scope
  2. Volunteer scientist "Affiliates" verify biological research relevance and no public harm
- **Rejection rate**: ~5% of submissions rejected
- **Your paper**: Theoretical neuroscience/consciousness is well within scope (many consciousness papers posted)

### Step 5: After Posting

- **DOI**: You receive a permanent DOI immediately when posted
- **Versioning**: bioRxiv uses single DOI for all versions; version-specific URLs available (e.g., v1, v2)
- **Updates**: You can upload revised versions anytime (add "Revision Summary" to explain changes)
- **After journal acceptance**: Update bioRxiv metadata with published DOI per NoC requirements

---

## 3. PsyArXiv Submission Process (ALTERNATIVE)

**Use only if you decide bioRxiv is not appropriate.**

### Step 1: Create OSF Account
- **URL**: https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/
- Click "Add a preprint"
- Register with email or ORCID credentials ([PsyArXiv FAQ](https://blog.psyarxiv.com/faq-frequently-asked-questions/))
- **No cost** for submission

### Step 2: Prepare Manuscript

**File format**: PDF (up to 5 GB)
- Use existing `/home/jeltz/aIware/paper/full/arxiv/paper.pdf`

**Metadata**:
- Title, author, email (must match PDF)
- ORCID: 0009-0005-9697-1665
- Abstract
- **Declare**: Dataset availability (none), preregistration status (none), conflicts of interest (none)
- **Tags/keywords**: Add relevant terms during upload

### Step 3: Submit via Five-Step Process

1. Visit https://psyarxiv.com/ and click "Add a preprint"
2. Upload PDF or import from OSF project
3. Enter metadata (exact match to PDF)
4. Choose license: **CC-BY Attribution 4.0** recommended (57% of PsyArXiv uses this) ([PsyArXiv licensing](https://blog.psyarxiv.com/2018/05/14/licensing-work-psyarxiv/))
5. Submit for moderation

### Step 4: Pre-Moderation

- **Timeline**: 24-72 hours ([PsyArXiv moderation timeline](https://blog.psyarxiv.com/faq-frequently-asked-questions/))
- **Private during moderation**: Not publicly visible until approved
- **Checks**: Moderators verify scholarly psychology scope, author metadata matches PDF, contact email on title page, adequate abstract
- **Scope risk**: Consciousness papers appear on PsyArXiv ([example](https://psyarxiv.com/jfuws/)), but theoretical neuroscience framing may face scrutiny

### Step 5: After Posting

- **DOI versioning**: Each version gets new DOI with suffix (e.g., DOI_v1, DOI_v2) ([PsyArXiv DOI versioning](https://blog.psyarxiv.com/2025/04/16/new-to-psyarxiv-doi-versioning/))
- **Updates**: Upload new versions anytime; cannot delete old versions (transparency)
- **After journal acceptance**: Add published DOI to metadata

## 4. DOI and Versioning Summary

| Feature | bioRxiv | PsyArXiv |
|---------|---------|----------|

| **Versioning** | Single DOI, version-specific URLs (v1, v2) | New DOI per version (DOI_v1, DOI_v2) |
| **Updates allowed** | Yes, unlimited revisions | Yes, unlimited revisions |
| **Old versions** | All versions retained | All versions retained (cannot delete) |
| **Citation tracking** | Consolidated under one DOI | Split across version DOIs |

## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Metadata mismatch**: Author name/order in PDF ≠ metadata → **rejection/delay** ([PsyArXiv FAQ](https://blog.psyarxiv.com/2016/09/19/psyarxiv-faq/))
2. **Posting too hastily**: "Most people read your manuscript once—you don't get a second chance to make a first impression" ([Nature Index tips](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/tips-how-to-most-successful-preprint-research-science-submission-study))
3. **Using journal-formatted version**: Copyrighted journal layout may be rejected; use author version
4. **Not checking journal policy**: Review NoC policy first (already confirmed: preprints OK)
5. **Forgetting to update after acceptance**: Must add published DOI per OUP policy
6. **File format errors**: bioRxiv requires PDF (not Word/LaTeX source as primary file)
7. **Missing contact email on title page**: PsyArXiv specifically checks for this

2. **Post soon** while NoC is under review to maximize visibility and citation potential (65% boost according to memory context)
3. **Use CC-BY 4.0 license** to retain credit while allowing open reuse
4. **Triple-check metadata** matches PDF exactly before submitting
5. **Update after journal acceptance** with published DOI per OUP requirements
6. **Don't worry about dual posting** - you can only choose one platform anyway
