Subject: Remote presentation inquiry — contributed talk/poster submission

Dear organizers,

I am submitting an abstract for the neurophenomenology satellite workshop ("Formalizing the Real-Virtual Gap: The Four-Model Theory as a Bridge Between Phenomenology and Computational Neuroscience"). Family and health circumstances make international travel infeasible for me at this time. Would it be possible to present remotely via video link? I am happy to adapt to whatever format works best for the workshop — contributed talk or poster.

Best regards,
Matthias Gruber

=== TITLE ===
Formalizing the Real-Virtual Gap: The Four-Model Theory as a Bridge Between Phenomenology and Computational Neuroscience

=== ABSTRACT (300 words) ===

Neurophenomenology's core commitment — that first-person experience and third-person neuroscience must mutually constrain each other — has remained more programmatic than formal. Varela's (1996) call for "mutual constraints" identified the right desideratum but left open what structural bridge could connect lived experience to neural mechanism. I propose that the Four-Model Theory (FMT; Gruber 2015, under review at Neuroscience of Consciousness; preprint DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18669891) supplies exactly this bridge by grounding the phenomenological distinction between living-through and reflecting-upon in a computational architecture.

FMT holds that consciousness arises from real-time self-simulation across two kinds of models along two axes: scope (world vs. self) and mode (implicit/learned vs. explicit/simulated). The implicit models — an Implicit World Model and an Implicit Self Model — are substrate-level, perpetually non-conscious, and never directly available to experience. The explicit models are virtual, phenomenal, and transient: they constitute the lived world. Qualia exist only within this simulation, not at the substrate level, dissolving the Hard Problem by exposing a category error in asking why physical processing "feels."

This architecture formalizes Varela's mutual constraints: the implicit models correspond to the neurobiological domain, the explicit models to the phenomenological domain, and their dynamic coupling is the neurophenomenological circulation itself. Critically, the boundary between implicit and explicit has variable permeability — a mechanism that accounts for how contemplative training modulates the contents of consciousness and why psychedelic states, meditation, and hypnagogia share structural features. The Implicit Self Model grounds the phenomenological body-subject, while the Implicit World Model's continuous sensory updating honors enactivism's emphasis on organism-environment coupling. A criticality requirement (the substrate must operate at the edge of chaos) provides a necessary condition for the simulation to run.

I present nine testable predictions, including that ego-dissolution content during psychedelic states is controllable via concurrent sensory input — a prediction few competing theories generate.
