## Page 1: Nothing = Singularity (Homepage)

**Core argument:** "There is always everything, never nothing. Nothing is a platonic idea, like a perfect circle."

The page argues that absolute nothingness cannot exist. At the smallest scales (Planck regime), the universe reveals singularities rather than emptiness — black holes are spacetime singularities we encounter through observation. At the largest scales, the dominant cosmological theory is "heat death" — the universe thins infinitely until no further events occur. But this resembles the pre-Big Bang state, which emerged through a "quantum fluctuation," implying infinitesimal non-nothingness.

"The 'end of the universe' cannot be an absolute end" because "nothing" cannot exist by definition. Possible mechanisms include final black hole evaporation, proton decay, vacuum decay, or coincidence.

At the largest accessible scales, the universe exhibits relatively uniform distribution through the "cosmic web" — superclusters, galaxy filaments, and nearly-empty voids expanding increasingly rapidly.

Due to causality's speed limit (c) and accelerating expansion, humans cannot connect with anything "outside" our observable universe — another singularity that, per Leibniz's principle of indiscernibles, may not represent genuine difference.

**Key philosophical claims:**
- Nothing is a platonic idea (cannot exist in reality)
- Singularities bookend every scale of the universe
- The observable universe may be a kind of singularity (Leibniz)

## Page 2: Universal Properties

**Opening quote:** "Monotonous, Periodic, Fractal, Interesting, Chaotic"

Asks whether the local universe will repeat. Answer: no, "not precisely at least, or maybe a couple of times, but not forever. Because there is no perfect periodicity either." "Another platonic idea."

Discusses atomic clocks — the best as of 2022 "deviate by less than a second in 20 million years" but would be off by more than 15 minutes since the universe's beginning.

References John Conway and Stephen Wolfram, identifying "five classes of things: Monotonous, periodic, fractal, chaotic and..." plus a fifth category. Describes Conway's Game of Life as sitting "between fractalness and chaos," calling it "interesting."

**Key claims:**
- "Monotony and periodicity are the same, mathematically and logically, and both do not exist in reality. They are platonic."
- "Pure randomness also doesn't exist."
- "Even our best random number generators have obvious regularities."
- Quantum physics "is incomplete at best, plain wrong possibly" despite being "our most precise theory."
- "Maybe it is ALMOST, not total randomness underlying the quantum world. Pure random is another platonic idea."
- The universe exists in "either the regime of fractalness or of interestingness," with fractal rulesets "certainly not complex enough to explain most of the effects we see."

## Page 3: Theory of Everything

Proposes that "the universe follows the simplest possible interesting rule" (Occam's razor). The fundamental rule might be the Langton Ant or even successive integers (n2 = n1 + 1), noting that prime number distribution demonstrates comparable complexity.

"From this emerges everything else, and that is why mathematics is so successful an instrument in physics."

Because nothingness cannot exist, an infinite, infinitely interesting universe must exist — potentially infinite in space, time, scale, and dimensionality. This creates a universe simultaneously deterministic and unpredictable at extreme scales, similar to Conway's Game of Life.

**The Mobius Infinity Concept:** Introduces "Mobius-Infinite" as a distinct type of infinity. An ant traversing a Mobius strip appears to loop infinitely, yet aging and relativistic effects prevent actual return. Event horizons and singularities prevent true cyclical completion.

Concludes that two of three ultimate questions — "life, the universe, and everything" — have been addressed, with "everything" answering why the universe exists.

## Page 4: Life (don't read!)

**Warning:** "If you are easily scared, you should stop reading now, because what follows from this simplest possible theory of everything may be the most scary thing you could ever imagine!"

Argues that consciousness didn't "suddenly come into existence out of nothing" but gradually emerged. Your sense of self developed progressively through lived experience and memories.

**Key claim about death:** "Tonight you will die though, and tomorrow someone else will wake up with your body, brain and memories, convinced he is you, but not really you."

Draws a parallel to total amnesia, where consciousness continues despite memory loss. Poses a hypothetical: if someone cloned you using DNA far in the future, you'd have an infant brain with no memories of your current life.

## Page 5: Mobius Immortality

**Central question:** "Does this mean we are reborn?"

Argues that while you won't remember a former life, someone could tell you what that previous version did, making you "KNOW that you are a kind of reincarnation." Questions how this knowledge would affect your perspective on death.

You currently lose brain cells continuously while believing you're the same person from ten minutes ago. If someone were born billions of years hence with nearly identical DNA, why wouldn't they also represent your rebirth?

"Is maybe every single consciousness somewhat similar, so that when you line them all up, sorted by similarity, you get a Mobius-infinite, continuous row of existences?"

**Response to objections:** You also "arose from nothing with no memories" initially, yet feel continuous existence. References retrograde amnesia patients who maintain a sense of self despite memory loss.

**Supporting example:** Anna Bagenholm survived 40 minutes under ice without circulation.

**Final assertion:** There's no way to experience nothingness, and consciousness experiencing the same universe across incarnations provides continuity across existence.

## Page 6: Time for Qualia

**Opening question:** Do we relive our own life repeatedly or experience every life in the universe?

The response relies on Occam's Razor, the Copernican Principle, and Leibniz's Law of the Identity of Indiscernibles. Conclusion: "we are experiencing all lives in a certain order, which really doesn't matter, maybe even repeatedly."

"So be nice to everyone, because you are everyone! And don't try to think about this too much. It might drive you crazy."

**Disclaimer:** This isn't rationalized immortality belief but speculation comparable to Many-Worlds Interpretation, Quantum Immortality, and the Simulation Hypothesis — none falsifiable or predictive.

**Three Difficult Questions:**

1. **"Is Mathematics invented or discovered?"** — Neither, referencing Godel's incompleteness theorems as the resolution.

2. **"What is time?"** — Discusses Einstein's conceptualization. Physical time appears unidirectional macroscopically, yet black hole physics demonstrates orthogonal switching of space-time directions. Key claim: "For conscious experience, the direction of physical time is irrelevant." Artificial neural networks operating in time-reverse would experience backward temporal flow from external perspectives.

3. **Consciousness Mechanics** — Deferred to the Consciousness page.

**Concluding guidance:** "Take care of yourself, just in case 'I' really have to live your life as well."

## Page 7: Consciousness

**Central question:** "How does our consciousness work? The sense of being right here and now, of feeling and living, or 'qualia', as some call it?"

**The Self-Model Theory:** What we identify as "I" does not directly observe reality. Rather, consciousness examines "a model which we confuse with our self, and it is only through that model that we can observe the outside world." "What we call 'I' has no direct interface to reality!"

Attributes this misunderstanding to "dualistic bias" and a "fundamental misconception we all have."

**Evidence:** References "Benjamin Libet's famous experiment" showing the illusion is "almost perfect, but just almost." "Certain brain injuries, mental techniques and also some drugs can lift the veil."

**The Nature of "Now":** Consciousness emerges from "a smeared out illusion of 'now.'" We cannot "deal consciously with live reality." "Now is something undefinable; no sensor in the world can measure or detect 'now.' It is platonic."

**Neurological Basis:** Describes consciousness as "a standing electron wave that behaves like a hologram and an interesting automaton." It emerges "from any capable cortical structure with rich underlying neural networks."

Proposes: "a neural network training and observing another one, the latter being continuously rewarded and punished by physical reality."

**Specific measurement:** "Our 'now' is about 200 milliseconds long."

**Performance:** Conscious reactions are "notably slower... as compared to mere reflexes." Athletes, "especially martial artists," describe actions as "happening automatically."
