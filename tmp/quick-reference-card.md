# Quick Reference Card — Press Campaign for "Die Simulation namens Ich"

## The Theory in 60 Seconds

"Your brain runs four computational models: two learn from the world unconsciously, two simulate the world consciously. Consciousness is what it feels like to inhabit those simulated models. Qualia (redness, pain, joy) exist only in the simulation, not in the physical neurons. This dissolves the 'hard problem' because it was based on a false assumption. The theory makes nine testable predictions and specifies what a conscious machine would need."

---

## The Theory in 10 Seconds

"Consciousness is a simulation your brain runs. Qualia exist in the simulation, not the hardware. The hard problem was a mislabeled question."

---

## Why This Matters (Pick One)

**For Science Journalists:**
"The Hard Problem has stumped neuroscience for 30 years. This theory dissolves it using a computational framework that explains psychedelics, sleep, meditation, and anesthesia all from one mechanism."

**For Tech Journalists:**
"Everyone asks if AI could be conscious. This theory gives concrete answers: here's the architecture, here are the tests, here's why current systems don't qualify but future ones could."

**For General Interest:**
"An independent researcher without a PhD developed a theory that might resolve one of science's biggest mysteries. How do outsiders challenge established fields?"

**For Academic Outlets:**
"The theory combines Metzinger, 't Hooft, Seth, and Wolfram in a new way, makes nine falsifiable predictions, and reframes a 30-year-old philosophical debate as solvable science."

---

## The Nine Predictions (Quick Version)

1. **Criticality required** — Consciousness needs edge-of-chaos brain dynamics
2. **Hierarchical structure** — Simulation requires multi-level processing
3. **Self-reference loop** — Conscious models must model themselves
4. **Psychedelic markers** — Psychedelics increase simulation/reality mismatch in measurable ways
5. **Sleep asymmetry** — REM sleep vs NREM show different simulation signatures
6. **Anesthesia pattern** — Anesthetics disable criticality in specific measurable ways
7. **Substrate independence** — Same architecture on silicon = consciousness
8. **Species markers** — Brain architecture predicts which animals should be conscious
9. **Measurement signature** — Consciousness has a specific neural correlate we can test for

## Your Credentials (If Asked)

**Short:** "I'm a biomedical engineer and self-taught consciousness researcher. I've been studying this since age 14, published the full theory (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18669891), and I'm R&D Manager at Ivoclar AG."

**If pressed on PhD:** "Fair question. I'm open to criticism—that's how science works. The theory is published with a DOI, all predictions are falsifiable. Ideas should be judged on merit. Historically, Mendel, Boltzmann, and Wegener weren't initially accepted either."

**Your advantage:** "I can read across philosophy, neuroscience, AI, and physics without academic silos. That perspective is rare."

## Common Objections & Comebacks

| Objection | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "You don't have credentials." | "The theory has a DOI. Prove me wrong experimentally." |
| "Consciousness is too subjective to study." | "Only subjective experience is subjective. The neural correlates are objective and measurable." |
| "Other theories explain this too." | "Name one that explains psychedelics, dreams, anesthesia, and makes testable predictions from a single mechanism." |
| "This is just philosophy." | "It's not. All nine predictions are experimentally falsifiable." |
| "The hard problem isn't solvable." | "It's not unsolvable—it was mislabeled. Category errors are 'unsolvable' until you see the error." |
| "Why should we take you seriously?" | "Because if I'm right, it changes how we understand consciousness, AI, and ethics. If I'm wrong, experiments will show it." |

## Email Pitch Template (Minimum)

```
Subject: [Specific hook about their recent article/topic]

Hi [Name],

I'm writing because you recently covered [their topic]. This connects to
a story you might find relevant:

A researcher just published a theory of consciousness that [your angle].
The theory makes [X] testable predictions and addresses [Y phenomenon].

[2-3 sentences on why this matters + why it's different]

Available for interview/review. Book + full scientific paper available.

"One of science's hardest problems might have a solution. The 'hard problem of consciousness' has stumped neuroscience for 30 years. A new theory argues it was mislabeled—and makes nine testable predictions. Now available in pop-sci form. [Link]"

### Twitter/X:
"Consciousness isn't mysterious. It was just mislabeled. New theory resolves the 30-year-old 'hard problem' with a testable framework. Why your brain runs a simulation. [Link]"

## Success Metrics (Track These)

- **Articles published:** Aim for 5+ in first 2 months
- **Podcast appearances:** Aim for 2-3 in first 3 months
- **Book sales:** Spike during/after coverage
- **Zenodo citations:** Monitor DOI views
- **Researcher emails:** Inbound from neuroscientists/AI researchers
- **Interview requests:** More requests = more credibility

---

## Next Journalist Email

If first pitch gets no response (after 10 days):

"Hi [Name],

Following up on my email about [theory/book]. I know you're busy, but
thought you might find this relevant given your recent coverage of [their topic].

[Slightly different angle or new detail]

Available for a quick call if you'd like to discuss.

[Your name]"

## The Bottom Line

You have a solid theory, it's testable, the timing is perfect, and the outsider angle is your strength. Media will respond to:

1. **Newsworthiness** (Hard Problem solved?)
2. **Controversy** (Independent researcher challenges mainstream)
3. **Timeliness** (AI consciousness debate is hot)
4. **Accessibility** (Explained in plain language)
5. **Testability** (This is science, not philosophy)

Lead with these. Every pitch should hit at least two of these points.
