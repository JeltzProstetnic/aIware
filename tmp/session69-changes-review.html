            By the time the theory crystallized at twenty-five, I had found the physicist Gerard 't Hooft articulating a strikingly similar intuition about the actual universe: his holographic principle suggests that all the information in a three-dimensional region of space can be encoded on its two-dimensional boundary. The universe itself might be, in some deep sense, a higher-dimensional experience running on a lower-dimensional substrate — exactly the structure I had built from a 286 running Conway's Game of Life. 't Hooft's holographic ideas became one of the two pillars of the theory, alongside Metzinger's self-model theory.

In fact, the cellular automaton framing was the part of the entire theory I was most unsure about. I could find no empirical backing for it at the time, and I almost didn't include it in the book — it felt like a step too far, a claim that would make the rest of the theory easy to dismiss. I included it because the logic seemed inescapable, not because I had evidence.

            The Four-Model Theory itself builds substantially on Thomas Metzinger's self-model theory of subjectivity (Metzinger, 2003), which I regard as probably correct at its core. The present cosmological extension — specifically the idea that the universe might be a cellular automaton operating under holographic constraints — was already present in embryonic form in my 2015 book, where 't Hooft's holographic bound was discussed in a cosmological context (Gruber, 2015, pp. 79–80). The full SB-HC4A architecture developed here represents the mature formulation of those early intuitions.
