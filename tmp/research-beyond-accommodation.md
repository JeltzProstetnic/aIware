## Main Thesis

This is a commentary on Fleming & Shea's "structural turn" within computational functionalism — their move toward grounding consciousness in the *relational geometry* of neural activation spaces (quality spaces, lateral connectivity, "silent units" that shape space geometry without being active).

Ellia & Tsuchiya make three arguments:

1. **The structural turn is welcome but not novel.** IIT already predicted these structural insights from its axioms — intrinsic causal structure determines phenomenal character, including latent/possible states.

2. **Structural properties + functional grounding = incoherent.** If the geometry of the activation space (including regions defined by silent units) determines quality, then you're grounding consciousness in *structural* properties, not *functional* roles. You can't have it both ways. Structural properties require structural grounding — which is what IIT provides and functionalism cannot.

3. **Post-hoc accommodation ≠ genuine prediction.** IIT predicted structural quality properties from axioms *before* quality space experiments. Functionalism accommodated them *after*. Credit goes to theories that predict, not those that accommodate.

## What "Structural Turn" Means

**Broad sense** (Kleiner, 2024): Movement across consciousness science from verbal descriptions to mathematical/structural tools — quality spaces, IIT's Φ-structure, Q-spaces, etc.

**Narrow sense** (this paper): Within computational functionalism specifically, moving from activation-based accounts to accounts that care about relational structure of state spaces. Ellia & Tsuchiya argue this partial turn is *unstable* — once you admit structural properties matter, you've stepped outside functionalism into IIT territory.

**Meta-theoretical framework** (Ellia & Tsuchiya companion preprint, "Intrinsic Universal Structures and Extrinsic Local Functions"):
- Three dimensions: perspective (1st/3rd person), scope (universal/local), explanatory medium (structural/functional)
- IIT clusters: intrinsic-universal-structural
- Computational functionalism (GWT, HOT, PP): extrinsic-local-functional
- The structural turn within functionalism tries to move along the third dimension while staying functional — which they argue is incoherent

## Engagement with Major Theories

### Global Workspace Theory
- GWT explains *access* (when content gets globally broadcast) but not *quality* (why experience has specific phenomenal character)
- Silent units problem: can't broadcast geometry defined by never-activated neurons
- **FMT alignment**: FMT section 7.2 makes the same critique — "GNW's empirically tractable broadcasting mechanism provides a clear account of access consciousness. However, it is silent on the Hard Problem."

### Integrated Information Theory
- IIT is the paper's positive reference — defended as already providing structural grounding
- IIT's qualia space (Φ-structure) already characterizes experience geometry from intrinsic causal analysis
- IIT naturally handles silent units (analyzes full cause-effect structure including possible transitions)

### Higher-Order Theories
- HOT explains *which* states are conscious (those with higher-order representations) but not *why* they have phenomenal character
- HOSS variant (Fleming & Shea's lean HOT) escapes silent units but collapses toward localism

### Predictive Processing
- Not directly engaged, but Ellia & Tsuchiya's framework places PP in the "extrinsic-local-functional" cluster
- PP can accommodate quality space (generative models generate structured representations) but lacks intrinsic grounding for *why* the geometry determines phenomenal quality

## Stance on Hard Problem

Committed and unambiguous: **the hard problem is real and functionalism cannot address it.**

Functionalist theories explain why systems *behave as if* they have quality spaces, but not why similarity relations in activation space *feel like anything*. The structural turn is an improvement but still insufficient from within functionalism.

IIT's methodology — starting from axioms of experience and deriving physical requirements — is the right approach because it grounds phenomenality *intrinsically*.

## HIGH RELEVANCE TO FMT

### FMT's Position in the Landscape

FMT occupies a *distinctive* position that this paper illuminates:

- FMT is **NOT standard computational functionalism** — section 4.1 explicitly adds the real/virtual level distinction to standard functionalism
- FMT shares key **structuralist commitments with IIT**: phenomenal character ≠ functional role, quality reflects intrinsic/structural properties, hard problem is dissolved
- **Key difference**: IIT grounds qualia in intrinsic causal power (Φ); FMT grounds them in ontological level distinction (virtual vs. substrate)
- In Ellia & Tsuchiya's 3D framework, **FMT clusters with IIT** (intrinsic-universal-structural), not with functionalism

### Quality Space Maps onto EWM/IWM

- Quality space of perceptual experience = structural organization of the **EWM** (conscious simulation of the world)
- Geometry of quality space determined by the **IWM** (learned similarity structure in synaptic weights)
- **Silent units** = IWM's latent structure — learned patterns defining EWM geometry even when not instantiated
- FMT can accept Fleming & Shea's neural mechanism at substrate level (IWM) while grounding phenomenal quality at virtual level (EWM)

### Where FMT Survives Their Critique

FMT survives the main critique because it's **not functionalist in the relevant sense** — qualia are grounded in virtual ontology, not functional role.

### Where IIT Researchers Would Press FMT

1. **Is virtual ontology intrinsic?** They'd want to know if the virtual level is characterized *from within* (yes — self-referential closure) or externally
2. **Mathematical quality space?** IIT has Φ-structure; FMT doesn't yet have mathematical formalization of quality (acknowledged gap in section 9)
3. **Explicit quality space predictions?** FMT implies IWM latent structure shapes EWM geometry, but doesn't make this explicit in quality space vocabulary

### Optimal Rhetorical Strategy

> "Ellia & Tsuchiya correctly identify the deficiency of functionalism. FMT shares their diagnosis but proposes a different cure — one that avoids IIT's specific costs (panpsychism, intractability of Φ, the unfolding argument) while grounding phenomenality in structural/ontological terms rather than functional ones."

### Citation Strategy

- **Section 7** (Comparative Analysis): cite when arguing GWT and HOT are insufficient for quality/phenomenality
- **Positioning FMT**: cite to establish the theoretical space, then explain how FMT occupies it differently from IIT
- **Quality structure discussions**: cite to connect EWM quality organization to quality space literature
- **Do NOT cite as endorsing FMT** — they are IIT researchers who would have questions about non-IIT grounding

### Engagement Opportunity

Francesco Ellia is at ATR Kyoto (JSPS Qualia Structure program). Overlapping concerns — structural grounding of qualia, rejection of functionalism. Differences (IIT vs. virtual qualia) are substantive but not incommensurable. Natural interlocutors.

## Bottom Line

**Highly relevant to FMT.** This paper defines the battleground between structural/intrinsic theories (IIT) and functional/extrinsic theories (GWT/HOT/PP). FMT is a *third position* — not IIT's intrinsic causal power, not functionalism's multiply-realizable function, but ontological level distinction (virtual vs. substrate). The paper helps articulate what's wrong with functionalism in a way FMT agrees with, while FMT resolves it differently than IIT.
