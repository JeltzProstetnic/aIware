Dear Editors,

I am submitting the manuscript "Why Intelligence Models Must Include Motivation: A Recursive Framework" for consideration in Philosophical Psychology.

The paper argues that the systematic exclusion of motivation from formal intelligence models — including CHC, Cattell's investment theory, and Sternberg's triarchic theory — constitutes a philosophical blind spot, not merely a methodological simplification. It proposes a recursive three-component framework (Knowledge × Performance × Motivation) and traces the consequences of this exclusion for intelligence theory, educational practice, and artificial intelligence.

I believe this work fits well within Philosophical Psychology's mission of strengthening the links between philosophy and the psychological sciences. The paper engages a question that is simultaneously philosophical (what is intelligence, structurally?) and psychological (how does it develop?), and offers a framework that generates testable empirical predictions while addressing a conceptual gap in the existing literature.

The manuscript is not under consideration at any other journal and has not been published elsewhere. A preprint is available on PsyArXiv (https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg).

Thank you for considering this work.

Sincerely,
Matthias Gruber
