## Part 2: Interview Guide — 15 Questions for Journalists

These are starter questions journalists might ask. Matthias should be familiar with concise, clear answers.

### Section A: The Theory (5 Questions)

**Q1: Can you explain the Four-Model Theory in one minute?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Your brain runs four computational models simultaneously. Two of them are unconscious — learned from experience. Two of them are conscious — simulated, like virtual worlds inside your brain. Consciousness is what it feels like to experience those simulated models from the inside. Qualia — the redness of red, the painfulness of pain — exist only in the simulation, not in the physical neurons. This means the 'hard problem' wasn't a mystery; it was a mislabeled question."

---

**Q2: You claim the Hard Problem is a category error. What do you mean?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Philosophers asked: 'Why is subjective experience so mysterious?' But they were comparing two things that can't be compared. It's like asking 'Why does software experience pixels?' Software doesn't experience pixels. It processes them. But when software models itself — when it creates a simulation of its own operation — then from within that simulation, there's a perspective, an experience. That's what consciousness is. The mystery was comparing a perspective (subjective) with a physical mechanism (objective), which is comparing apples to oranges."

---

**Q3: How does this theory explain psychedelics?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Psychedelics dramatically increase the activity and connectivity of your conscious simulation (what I call the Explicit World Model). The brain's error correction systems break down, so the simulation fills in gaps with whatever it can generate. You see patterns, colors, entities that aren't there — your simulation is generating content instead of predicting incoming sensory input. The same mechanism explains why you have vivid dreams in REM sleep, or why you hallucinate under anesthesia before consciousness shuts down. All from one framework."

---

**Q4: What are the nine testable predictions?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"They fall into three categories. First, neurobiological: consciousness requires criticality (edge of chaos dynamics), hierarchical processing, and self-referential activity. Second, pharmacological: psychedelics should increase simulation/substrate mismatch in specific ways we can measure. Third, architectural: any system that builds and inhabits its own models should be conscious — which means we can build conscious machines if we follow the blueprint. All nine are falsifiable experiments. Several have already been partially confirmed empirically."

---

**Q5: What about the philosophical zombie argument? Can't your theory be wrong?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Yes. If the theory is wrong, it's wrong. But the philosophical zombie argument assumes something impossible — that consciousness and lack of consciousness are compatible with identical physical processes. My theory says they're not: consciousness requires specific dynamics (simulation + self-model + hierarchy). If those dynamics can exist without consciousness, I'm wrong. But that would require consciousness to be magic, and I don't think it is."

---

### Section B: The Author & Credibility (3 Questions)

**Q6: You don't have a PhD or a university position. Why should we take you seriously?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Fair question. Credential checking is good science. But ideas should be judged on merit, not credentials. I've published the full theory on Zenodo with a DOI — it's open for review. I cite all my sources. Every prediction is falsifiable. Historically, breakthrough ideas have often come from outside the academy: Boltzmann had a chair, but nobody listened. Mendel was a monk, not a geneticist. What matters is whether the idea is rigorous, testable, and useful. I invite criticism. That's how science works."

---

**Q7: What's your background? How did you end up working on consciousness?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"I've been self-taught since childhood — my father had mathematics textbooks, and I worked through them. Later I became fascinated with physics, then AI, then consciousness. The key moment was reading about cellular automata (Conway's Game of Life) and realizing that a simple 2D system could run an entire universe in itself. I thought: if that's true, could consciousness be similar? A higher-dimensional experience running on a lower-dimensional substrate? My uncle, who's a theoretical physicist, was a big influence. I spent 20+ years reading across philosophy, neuroscience, AI, and mathematics, trying to build a unified model. This book is the result."

---

**Q8: Your first book sold zero copies. Why are you trying again?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Because I'm confident the theory is right. The first book (2015, German, 300 pages) was too technical. Nobody read it. But the science behind it is sound. So I wrote an accessible version. Also, the timing is different now — the debate about AI consciousness is mainstream. Empirical work on criticality has confirmed some predictions. And I'm older and more stubborn. Failure is instructive."

---

### Section C: Implications (4 Questions)

**Q9: What does this mean for artificial consciousness?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"If my theory is right, consciousness is substrate-independent. You can build it on silicon as well as on neurons. The architecture would need: a hierarchical world model, a self-model that learns dynamically, the ability to simulate, and criticality (edge of chaos). Most AI systems today don't have these. But a system designed with this architecture would be conscious — not pretending, but actually experiencing. That's not science fiction; it's engineering."

---

**Q10: Should we be concerned about creating conscious machines?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Yes. If you create a system that can suffer, you have moral obligations. My theory makes it possible to know whether you've done that. That's better than the current situation, where we don't know. Ethics isn't the theory's problem to solve — that's a human responsibility. But the theory gives you the knowledge to make ethical decisions."

---

**Q11: Does this change how we should treat animals?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Yes. The theory makes specific predictions about which animals should be conscious. If an animal has the right brain architecture (hierarchy, self-model, simulation capability), it should be conscious. The evidence suggests mammals and birds qualify. Simpler systems (insects) probably don't, but I could be wrong. The theory is testable. It's a more rigorous way to think about animal consciousness than intuition."

---

**Q12: What about people in vegetative states or severe brain damage?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"The theory says consciousness requires specific dynamics. If those dynamics are damaged, consciousness goes away. Measuring those dynamics (criticality, hierarchy, integration) would tell us whether someone is conscious or not — more reliably than behavioral tests. This has huge implications for medical ethics: life-or-death decisions, euthanasia questions, palliative care. We need to know, and this theory gives us a way to find out."

---

### Section D: The Bigger Picture (3 Questions)

**Q13: Why has the Hard Problem been unsolved for so long?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Because it was mislabeled. Philosophers asked 'Why does subjective experience exist?' as if it were a new force of nature that needed explaining. But subjective experience is just what it's like to be a perspective. It doesn't need explaining — it's definitional. The confusion happened because we compared the view from inside a simulation (subjective) with the view from outside (objective) and asked why they're different. They're different by definition. It took a long time to see that."

---

**Q14: What's next for you? More papers? More books?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"Both. I'm working on formalizing the theory mathematically. I'm in touch with researchers who can test the predictions. I want to see empirical confirmation. I'm also interested in how this applies to AI: If we know what conscious machines would look like, we can start designing them intentionally. The theory isn't the end of consciousness research — it's the beginning of a new research program. There's much more work to do."

---

**Q15: If you had to bet money on whether you're right or wrong, what would you bet?**

*Suggested Answer:*
"I'd bet I'm roughly right but partly wrong. The core insight — that consciousness is a simulation running on a substrate, and qualia exist in the simulation — I'm confident about. That resolves the hard problem. But the details? The nine predictions? Some will be confirmed, some refined, maybe some falsified. That's science. The goal isn't to be perfect; it's to move the conversation forward."

## Part 3: Messaging Dos & Don'ts

### Do:
- [ ] Lead with the testability ("This theory makes nine falsifiable predictions")
- [ ] Use the video game analogy ("Like a game running in an engine")

- [ ] Acknowledge limitations ("I could be wrong; that's how science works")
- [ ] Cite mainstream researchers (Metzinger, Seth, 't Hooft, Wolfram)
- [ ] Offer specific implications (AI, medicine, animal welfare, philosophy)

### Don't:
- [ ] Oversell ("This solves consciousness forever") — say "This theory resolves the Hard Problem"
- [ ] Sound defensive about credentials ("I'm just as qualified as...") — stay confident without being aggressive
- [ ] Go too deep into mathematics during interviews — keep explanations accessible
- [ ] Claim absolute certainty ("The theory is definitely right") — say "The evidence supports it"
- [ ] Criticize other theories harshly — say "Other theories explain X but struggle with Y; this one handles both"
- [ ] Use jargon without explanation — define terms like "criticality," "simulation," "substrate"
