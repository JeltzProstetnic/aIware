# Tracked Paper Creation Summary

## Task Completed
Created `/home/jeltz/aIware/paper/full/four-model-theory-full-tracked.md` — a tracked-changes version of the full paper with three proposed insertions from Session 53's Perplexity review analysis.

## File Statistics
- **Original paper**: 954 lines
- **Tracked version**: 1,020 lines (+66 lines)
- **File size**: 143 KB
- **Insertions**: 3 proposed additions, all clearly marked

## Changes Made

### 1. Section 3.4 Addition (Line 193-198)
**Location**: After the self-referential closure argument in Section 3.4
**Content**: Identity claim framing (H₂O analogy)
**Rationale**: Addresses "Why should we accept this as an answer?" critique. Frames the theory as making a falsifiable identity claim rather than requiring further explanation.

### 2. Section 4.2 Addition (Line 325-332)
**Location**: After the dual evaluation architecture paragraph in Section 4.2
**Content**: "Simulation must feel" functional necessity argument
**Rationale**: Addresses why phenomenality is functionally necessary for evaluation, not epiphenomenal. Distinguishes from both classical epiphenomenalism and standard functionalism.

### 3. Section 6.7 Addition (New Section, Line 505-526)
**Location**: New section inserted between Section 6.6 and Section 7
**Content**: Developmental Psychology Bridge (full section)
**Rationale**: Bridges theory to developmental psychology literature; generates testable predictions about mirror self-recognition, theory of mind, social deprivation, and CBT.
