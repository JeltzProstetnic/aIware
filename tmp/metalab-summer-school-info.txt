MetaLab Summer School on Consciousness and Metacognition 2026
=============================================================

Host: Stephen Fleming's Metacognition Lab (UCL)
Dates: July 8-10, 2026
Location: London, UK
Deadline: Midnight Saturday, February 28, 2026 (6 days)

ELIGIBILITY: "Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows"
  → ~50% spots reserved for UCL, rest open to other institutions
  → Independent researchers not explicitly included — may need to frame carefully

COST: Free. Covers accommodation + social dinner. Up to £200 travel support.
PRIZE: £2,500 fund for selected innovators testing proposed ideas.

APPLICATION: Form on website. Requires:
  - Institutional affiliation
  - Proposed "innovation" you want to explore during the program

FOCUS THIS YEAR: "New innovations" in consciousness research — novel methodologies,
technologies, theoretical frameworks, collaborative approaches.
Past examples: adversarial collaborations, metacognitive capacities of AI.

SPEAKERS: Not listed yet.

WHY IT'S RELEVANT:
  - Fleming authored "Quality space computations for consciousness" (2024) — directly
    relevant to FMT's EWM quality structure
  - Metacognition = self-modeling = FMT's ESM
  - "Innovations" framing is perfect for proposing FMT as a testable framework
  - Networking with Fleming's group + UCL consciousness researchers
  - Templeton-funded (they fund consciousness research broadly)

TWO ISSUES:
  1. TRAVEL: Session context says "no international travel, DACH only."
     London is outside DACH. Is this still the constraint?

  2. ELIGIBILITY: "Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows" — you're neither.
     Options: (a) apply anyway and frame as "independent researcher" — worst case
     they say no; (b) mention the book publication and papers under review as
     equivalent scholarly activity; (c) skip it.
