Dear André,

Thank you for your honest response — I genuinely appreciate the candor, and a high bar is exactly what I need.

I think you're right that asking whether any consciousness theory is "correct" is premature — we're probably decades away from that. What the field needs first are viable falsification criteria, and that's where I hope my contribution lies.

Section 8 (starting page 39) presents nine testable predictions. The two I consider most distinctive are Predictions 3 and 4 (pages 40-41): that ego dissolution content is controllable via sensory input, and that psychedelics should alleviate anosognosia — both derived from the same mechanism (variable implicit-explicit permeability). No competing theory I'm aware of generates either prediction.

There's also a prediction that has arguably already survived its first test: the theory requires the substrate to operate at criticality (derived from Wolfram's computational framework in 2015). A decade later, the empirical criticality literature independently consolidated around the same conclusion (Hengen & Shew, 2025; Algom & Shriki, 2026). That convergence doesn't prove anything, but it's a prediction that was not falsified when it could have been.

So my specific question: Do these predictions constitute genuine falsifiability that distinguishes this framework, or could IIT, GNW, PP, or AST accommodate them equally well?

That's about 3 pages of focused reading rather than 60.

Best regards,
Matthias
