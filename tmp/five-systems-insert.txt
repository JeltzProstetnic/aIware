But before we dive into each model, I need to give you a framework for thinking about where these models live. Because when I say "the brain creates a simulation," I'm not talking about a single level of processing. I'm talking about a hierarchy of five nested systems, each supervening on the one below, each with its own dynamics — and consciousness sits at the very top.

### Five Nested Systems

Think of your brain as having five distinct levels of organization, stacked like Russian dolls:

**Physical.** At the bottom, you have the raw matter: atoms, molecules, the physical substrate of the brain itself. This is the chemistry — the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen that compose the tissue. It's inert matter obeying the laws of thermodynamics. Nothing conscious lives here.

**Electrochemical.** One level up: neural signaling. Action potentials racing down axons, neurotransmitters flooding synapses, ions flowing through channels. This is the electrical and chemical activity that everyone pictures when they think "brain doing something." This is the level where neurons fire. Still no experience, but now you have information transmission.

**Proteomic.** Next: protein structures and molecular machinery. Synaptic weights are stored here — the physical strengths of connections between neurons. Receptors on cell membranes, enzymes regulating plasticity, the molecular scaffolding that determines which synapses grow stronger and which weaken. This is the "hardware" of learning. When you practice a skill and get better at it, you're changing the proteomic layer. Still unconscious, but now you have memory.

**Topological.** Higher still: network architecture. The patterns of connectivity — which neurons connect to which, how densely, in what configurations. This is where Brodmann areas live, where cortical columns live, where the large-scale structure of "visual cortex talks to motor cortex" exists. It's the wiring diagram. Change this level and you change what kinds of processing the system can do. This is where your implicit models — the IWM and ISM — are stored. Still unconscious. But now you have knowledge.

**Virtual.** At the very top: the simulated world. The cortical automaton — the dynamic pattern of electrical activity dancing across the network, integrating information, generating predictions, running the models in real time. This is where your conscious experience lives. The explicit models — the EWM and ESM — exist here and only here. This is the only level that feels like anything.

Each level supervenes on the one below it but has its own dynamics. You can't have electrochemical signaling without physical matter, you can't have protein structures without chemistry, you can't have network topology without synapses, and you can't have a simulation without a network to run it. But each level has properties the lower levels don't have. A synapse is not "about" anything — it's just a connection. A network of synapses *is* about something: it represents a face, a word, a memory. And the simulation running on that network? That's where "about" becomes "experience."

This five-level hierarchy solves a problem that trips up almost everyone when they first hear this theory: "If consciousness is virtual, what's it running on?" The answer: it's running on the topological layer (the network), which is implemented in the proteomic layer (synaptic weights), which runs on the electrochemical layer (neural firing), which exists in the physical layer (matter). Consciousness is no less real for being virtual — it's just real *at a different level* than neurons are real. The mountain in the video game is real at the game level even though it's "just" transistors at the hardware level. Same principle.

I'll come back to this hierarchy throughout the book, especially when we talk about psychedelics in Chapter 6 — because drugs don't hit all five levels equally. Some target the electrochemical layer (altering neurotransmitter dynamics), some target the proteomic layer (changing receptor expression), and the effects ripple up to the virtual layer in predictable ways. The hierarchy isn't just conceptual. It's mechanistically real, and it does explanatory work.

Now, the four models.
