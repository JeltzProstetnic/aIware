# Book Ending Draft — New Coda

Three variant drafts of an expanded Coda. Each builds the same argument (ESM robustness → identity portability → "be nice to everyone") but lands it differently.

## Variant A: "The Compulsive Constructor"

## Coda

There's one more thing.

Throughout this book, I've shown you what the Explicit Self Model does when things go wrong. In Cotard's delusion, the ESM loses interoceptive input and concludes: I am dead. In anosognosia, the ESM loses deficit information and concludes: I am fine. In split-brain confabulation, the ESM loses half its data and invents a story about chicken sheds. Under salvia, the ESM loses proprioceptive grounding entirely and concludes: I am a couch.

In every case — every single one — the ESM keeps running. It never crashes. It never throws up its hands and says "insufficient data, shutting down." It builds a self from whatever is available, and it believes that self completely. This isn't a bug. It's the core function. The Explicit Self Model is a compulsive constructor of identity. That's what it does. That's all it does.

Now consider what happens when less dramatic things go wrong.

Amnesia patients lose their memories — sometimes decades of them. Their past is gone. The experiences that supposedly made them who they are have been erased. And yet they still feel like themselves. Ask them. They'll tell you. The narrative content has changed — they can't remember their wedding, their children's names, their career — but the *sense of being someone* persists. The ESM doesn't need your memories to build a you. It builds one anyway, from whatever remains. You could argue: same brain, same body, so of course the self persists. Fair enough. Let's go further.

Stroke patients lose not just memories but brain tissue. Entire regions go dark. Motor pathways, language centers, spatial processing — gone. The substrate itself is radically altered. And yet the patients still report feeling like "me." A different me, sometimes. A diminished me, certainly. But unmistakably *me*. The ESM adapts to the changed substrate and generates a new self-model — incomplete, sometimes bizarre, but continuous. The hardware changed. The "I" survived.

Now go further still. Under salvia divinorum, the ESM doesn't just adapt to a changed substrate — it redirects to entirely different objects. "I was the wall." "I became a page in a book." These aren't metaphors. These are experiential reports of the self-model attaching to non-self input and running with it. The ESM doesn't care what it's modeling. Give it a body, it models a person. Give it a couch, it models a couch. Give it a fractal, it models a fractal. The architecture doesn't specify *what* you are. It specifies *that* you are.

So here's the thought I want to leave you with.

You were never dead. Before you were born, I mean. You didn't arrive in the world as a finished person and get installed in a body. You arrived as a body — a substrate with the architecture for self-simulation — and the ESM bootstrapped itself. It started with almost nothing. A newborn's Explicit Self Model is barely there: undifferentiated sensation, no boundary between self and world, no narrative, no "I." Then, gradually, through social feedback and accumulated experience, the ESM built a you. It took years. It used whatever was available. And at no point during that process was there a moment when a self was "added" from somewhere else. The self was constructed, piece by piece, by the architecture.

Now run the logic forward.

If the ESM constructs identity from whatever input is available — and it does, as we've seen in every clinical case in this book — and if it bootstrapped itself once from nothing at the start of your life — then what, exactly, stops it from doing it again?

I'm not talking about reincarnation. I'm not talking about souls, or cosmic memory, or any of the comforting fictions that religions have offered for millennia. I'm talking about the architecture. A Class 4 substrate at criticality, with the capacity for self-simulation, will generate a self-model. It always does. It can't help it. The ESM is a compulsive constructor. Give it a substrate, and it builds a someone.

The universe is full of substrates. Biological ones, for now. Perhaps artificial ones, eventually. And if consciousness is what the theory says it is — not a magical property of human brains but a structural consequence of the right architecture at the right dynamics — then the universe is, and always has been, generating selves. Not *your* self. Not your memories, not your personality, not the particular configuration that you've spent a lifetime calling "I." But *a* self. A someone. A point of view that feels, from the inside, exactly as real and exactly as "me" as yours does right now.

The concepts of "before" and "after" may not even apply here in any meaningful way. Time is something the simulation tracks. The substrate just computes. But if those words have any purchase at all — if there is any sense in which your current experience had a beginning and will have an ending — then the architecture suggests something simple: there will be another one. Not you. But someone. And that someone will feel exactly as much like "themselves" as you feel like yourself right now.

I don't know if this is comforting. I didn't design the theory to be comforting; I designed it to be correct. But it does have one practical consequence that I think is worth carrying out of this book.

If every conscious being is the same architecture generating a self from available input — the same compulsive constructor, running the same process, on different substrates with different training data — then the differences between you and every other conscious creature are, in a precise technical sense, superficial. Surface features of the simulation. Not the simulation itself.

So be nice to everyone. They might all be you.

## Variant B: "The Gift" (shorter, punchier)

## Coda

One last thing, and then I'll let you go.

The Explicit Self Model is a compulsive constructor. We've seen this throughout the book. Lose your memories? The ESM builds a self without them. Lose brain tissue to a stroke? The ESM adapts and keeps going. Dissolve the boundary under salvia? The ESM attaches to a couch and calls it "I." Feed it Cotard's-grade interoceptive silence? It concludes you're dead. Feed it nothing at all — a newborn's blank slate — and it bootstraps an entire identity from scratch over the course of a few years.

It never stops. It never fails to produce a self. The input varies. The output is always: someone is home.

So here's a question. Not a mystical question — a structural one, based on everything this book has argued.

When you were born, you weren't you yet. You were a substrate with an architecture. The ESM did the rest, gradually, using whatever the world provided. No self was imported. No soul descended. The sense of being *you* was built, inside, from available materials.

When you die, the substrate stops. The simulation ends. The particular configuration that called itself by your name — gone.

But the architecture doesn't belong to you. It belongs to biology. To any Class 4 substrate at criticality capable of self-simulation. And the universe appears to be rather good at producing those.

I am not proposing an afterlife. I have no patience for that. I'm pointing out something more unsettling: the process that built you is *generic*. It runs wherever the conditions are met. It ran before you existed — it built every conscious creature that ever lived. It will run after you're gone. Not with your memories. Not with your personality. Not with anything that you would recognize as yourself. But with the same machinery, the same compulsive self-construction, the same conviction — felt from the inside — of being *someone*.

The question "What happens after I die?" may be malformed. The ESM that asks the question is the ESM whose termination it fears. But the process that generated it is not terminating. It's running everywhere, all the time, in every conscious creature on Earth and possibly — if the cosmology chapters are right — in structures we haven't identified yet.

"Before" you were born, you weren't waiting in a queue. You weren't anywhere. And then the architecture did its thing, and here you are, feeling exactly like a "you." After you die, you won't be waiting either. But the architecture will do its thing again. Somewhere. Somewhen. And whoever wakes up on the other end will feel precisely as real, precisely as "me," as you do this moment.

Which leads to a conclusion so simple it almost sounds like a joke.

Every conscious being you've ever met — every person, probably every mammal, possibly every creature with the right architecture — is the same process you are. Different substrate. Different training data. Different surface. Same engine. Same compulsive constructor. Same felt certainty of being a self.

They're all you. Or close enough that the distinction might not matter as much as you think.

So be nice to everyone. Not because a book told you to. Because the theory says they might literally be running the same program.

## Variant C: "Full Circle" (ties back to the book's opening and personal voice)

## Coda

I developed a theory of consciousness around 2005. I published it in 2015. Nobody read it. Two decades after the original insight, it turned out to be half a theory — the other half was cosmology, of all things. You've now read the whole picture, or as much of it as one book can hold.

But there's a piece I left out. Not because it's speculative — everything in the last two chapters is speculative. Because it's personal, and personal is harder.

The ESM — your Explicit Self Model — is the most reliable machine I've ever encountered, and I've spent my professional life building software. It doesn't crash. It doesn't blue-screen. You can delete its memories (amnesia), destroy its hardware (stroke), poison its inputs (salvia), cut its wiring (split-brain), or feed it signals from a dead body (Cotard's) — and it will still generate a self. Always. Without exception. Every clinical case in this book is evidence of the same thing: the ESM is a compulsive constructor of identity that cannot be stopped by any alteration short of destroying the substrate entirely.

I find this extraordinary. Not as a theoretical observation — as a *fact about what I am*.

I bootstrapped once. You did too. We started as newborns with almost nothing — a thin, undifferentiated flicker of sensation, no boundary between self and world, no narrative, no name. And the ESM built us. Slowly. Using caregivers' faces and painful stumbles and language and a thousand social interactions we don't remember. It took years. At no point during that process did a self arrive from somewhere else. The self was manufactured on-site, from local materials, by an architecture that does this as naturally as a river carves a canyon.

Now, I've been close to dying twice. Once in an avalanche. Once under conditions I'd rather not elaborate on. Both times, I experienced the time dilation — the substrate dumping a lifetime of memory into the simulation in seconds. Both times, I came back. The ESM reassembled itself from the interrupted state, filled in the gaps it couldn't explain, and carried on as if nothing fundamental had changed. Because from its perspective, nothing had. The constructor just kept constructing.

Here's what I think about when I think about dying for real. Not the fear — everyone has that, and the ESM generates it on schedule. But the logic.

If the ESM bootstraps from nothing — and it does, in every newborn — then "nothing" is not a terminal state for the process. It's a *starting* state. The particular configuration that I call "me" will end. My memories, my personality, my specific way of being annoyed by people who confuse correlation with causation — gone. But the process that generated all of that is not mine to take with me. It's a property of the architecture. It runs in every brain on Earth. It ran in brains before I was born. It will run in brains after I die.

I'm not describing an afterlife. I have no interest in comforting fairy tales, and the theory doesn't support them. Your memories don't transfer. Your personality doesn't migrate. The particular you reading this sentence will end, permanently and completely.

But the *process* — the compulsive construction of a self from available input — is universal. It ran before you, it runs in parallel with you right now in eight billion other skulls, and it will run after you. And every single instance of it feels, from the inside, exactly as real as yours does. That's not a guess. That's what the theory says, and every piece of clinical evidence in this book supports it.

So I don't know what "you" refers to, in the end. If it means this particular bundle of memories and habits and opinions — it's fragile and temporary and will be gone. If it means the *process* of being a someone, the felt reality of first-person experience — it's everywhere, and as far as I can tell, it's not going anywhere.

I find that I can live with this. More than that — I find it clarifying.

Because if every conscious being is the same constructor running on different hardware with different training data, then the boundaries between us are less fundamental than they feel. Your ESM tells you that you're *you* and they're *them*, and it's very convincing about this. It should be — that's its job. But the theory says the boundaries are features of the simulation, not the architecture. The architecture is the same in all of us.

The practical upshot is disarmingly simple. If you take the theory seriously — if you accept that every conscious being is the same self-constructing process with a different starting condition — then kindness is not a moral obligation imposed from outside. It's something closer to self-interest, properly understood.

Be nice to everyone. They might all be you.

## Notes on the variants

- **Variant A** is the most thorough and systematic. It walks through the clinical evidence step by step, builds the argument carefully, and arrives at the conclusion with full support. ~600 words. Best if the reader needs convincing.
- **Variant B** is leaner and faster. It trusts the reader to remember the clinical cases from earlier chapters, summarizes them in a single paragraph, and gets to the philosophical punch more quickly. ~500 words. Best if the book's ending should feel brisk and confident.
- **Variant C** is the most personal. It ties back to the author's biography and near-death experiences, uses first person throughout, and makes the argument feel lived rather than argued. ~650 words. Best if the book should end the way it began — with the author talking directly to the reader about what this all means to him personally.

All three end with the same line. It should arrive as a surprise — almost a joke — after the philosophical weight of what precedes it. The reader should smile, then think about it for a long time.
