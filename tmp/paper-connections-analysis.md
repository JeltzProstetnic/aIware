**Paper 2:** Intelligence as Recursive Loop (planned for *New Ideas in Psychology*)

---

## 1. Shared Concepts: Mapping the Overlaps

The two papers share a surprisingly deep conceptual substrate. The overlap is not superficial; it arises because both papers emerge from the same unified theory originally published in the 2015 German book. The shared concepts are:

### 1.1 Cognitive Learning vs. Reinforcement Learning
- **Consciousness paper (Section 4.2, ~lines 296-298):** The four-model architecture enables "cognitive learning" -- inducing general theories from particular observations -- as distinct from reinforcement learning. The poisonous mushroom example is presented in full. This is framed as the *evolutionary advantage* of consciousness: third-person perspective simulation via EWM/ESM allows learning from observed deaths.
- **Intelligence paper (planned):** The same cognitive-vs-RL distinction is central, but framed differently: cognitive learning is what makes human intelligence *qualitatively different* from animal/machine intelligence. The recursive loop (Knowledge + Performance + Motivation) is fueled by cognitive learning, which consciousness enables.
- **Overlap severity: HIGH.** The mushroom example and the core argument appear in both. This is the single most important overlap to manage.

### 1.2 Recursion / Self-Reference
- **Consciousness paper (Section 3.5):** Graduated levels of consciousness are defined by *depth of recursive self-modeling*. Self-referential closure is the key to dissolving the Hard Problem (Section 3.4).
- **Intelligence paper (planned):** Intelligence itself is defined as a *recursive, self-reinforcing loop*: Knowledge feeds Performance, Performance feeds Knowledge, and Motivation amplifies both. The German book (p. 244, line 11940) explicitly calls intelligence "ein rekursives, selbstverstarkendes System."
- **Overlap severity: MODERATE.** The recursion is structural in both cases but operates at different levels -- consciousness recursion is about self-modeling depth, intelligence recursion is about the knowledge-performance-motivation feedback cycle.

### 1.3 The Implicit/Explicit Distinction
- **Consciousness paper (Sections 3.2-3.6):** The core architectural distinction between implicit (substrate-level, learned, non-conscious) and explicit (simulated, phenomenal) models.
- **Intelligence paper (planned):** Knowledge in the tripartite model splits into implicit and explicit forms (the German book references Polanyi's tacit knowledge in Ch. 3.1). The IWM stores implicit world-knowledge; the EWM makes portions of it explicit. This maps directly onto the Gf/Gc distinction: fluid intelligence (Gf) aligns roughly with "Leistung" (cognitive performance), crystallized intelligence (Gc) aligns with accumulated "Wissen" (knowledge).
- **Overlap severity: MODERATE.** The implicit/explicit split is architectural in the consciousness paper and epistemological in the intelligence paper.

### 1.4 Emergence and the "Tent in the Wind" Analogy
- **Consciousness paper (Section 4.3):** Consciousness is weakly emergent -- deducible in principle from substrate description but practically irreducible.
- **Intelligence paper (planned, from German book):** Intelligence is compared to a "tent in the wind" -- an emergent, dynamic property that cannot be predicted from the tent's material alone but requires understanding the relationships between components. Intelligence is not a fixed attribute but an emergent property of the Knowledge-Performance-Motivation system interacting with its environment.
- **Overlap severity: LOW.** Both use emergence, but the consciousness paper treats it formally while the intelligence paper would use it as an analogy for why intelligence is not a static trait.

### 1.5 Substrate Independence
- **Consciousness paper (Section 4.4):** Consciousness is substrate-independent; any system implementing the four-model architecture at criticality produces consciousness.
- **Intelligence paper (planned):** Intelligence is also substrate-independent in the sense that the recursive loop can operate on any substrate capable of cognitive learning. Current AI approximates some aspects but lacks the self-simulation required for genuine cognitive learning.
- **Overlap severity: LOW.** The AI angle is present in both but serves different arguments.

### 1.6 Critique of Reductive Measurement
- **Consciousness paper (Section 7):** Critiques IIT's Phi as reductive, GNW as incomplete, etc.
- **Intelligence paper (planned):** Critiques IQ/g-factor as reductive -- measuring only Leistung (performance) while ignoring Motivation and the recursive dynamics. The German book's line "Intelligenz ist, was der Intelligenztest misst" (intelligence is what the intelligence test measures) is the same kind of critique applied to different targets.
- **Overlap severity: LOW.** Structurally parallel arguments but in entirely different domains.

## 2. Complementary Arguments: How Each Paper Strengthens the Other

### 2.1 The Consciousness Paper Provides the Intelligence Paper's Foundation
The four-model architecture explains *why* cognitive learning exists and *how* it works mechanistically. Without the EWM and ESM, there is no third-person perspective simulation, no observational learning, no theory induction. The intelligence paper can say: "For the mechanism that enables cognitive learning, see [consciousness paper]." This means the intelligence paper does not need to re-derive the architecture; it can take it as given and focus on the implications for intelligence models.

### 2.2 The Intelligence Paper Extends the Consciousness Paper's Causal Role Argument
The consciousness paper's Section 4.2 argues that consciousness is not epiphenomenal because it enables cognitive learning. But this argument occupies only two paragraphs in a 9,000-word paper. The intelligence paper can develop this argument fully: consciousness is not just "useful" -- it enables an entirely different *kind* of intelligence, one that is recursive, self-amplifying, and qualitatively distinct from anything non-conscious systems can achieve. This strengthens the consciousness paper's causal-role argument by showing its downstream consequences in detail.

### 2.3 The Intelligence Paper Provides Empirical Grounding the Consciousness Paper Lacks
The consciousness paper's predictions are neuroscientific (fMRI, EEG, psychedelic studies). The intelligence paper can provide a different kind of empirical engagement: the existing literature on IQ, g-factor, Gf/Gc, multiple intelligences, and the well-documented failure of these models to capture real-world intellectual achievement. This is psychology-level evidence that complements the neuroscience-level evidence of the consciousness paper.

### 2.4 The Consciousness Paper Answers the Intelligence Paper's "So What?"
A critic of the intelligence paper might ask: "So intelligence is recursive -- what mechanism enables the recursion?" The consciousness paper answers: the four-model architecture, specifically the ESM's capacity for self-referential modeling, is what makes the recursive loop possible. Without consciousness, the loop degrades to simple reinforcement learning, which is not recursive in the relevant sense.

### 2.5 The Author's Biography Bridges Both Papers
The "About the Author" section of the book manuscript demonstrates the recursive intelligence loop in autobiographical detail. This personal narrative is more appropriate for the intelligence paper (in *New Ideas in Psychology*, personal example is legitimate) than for the consciousness paper (in *Neuroscience of Consciousness*, autobiography would be out of place). The consciousness paper's existence then validates the theoretical framework that the biography illustrates.

## 3. Cross-Reference Strategy

### 3.1 References FROM the Intelligence Paper TO the Consciousness Paper

**Location 1: When introducing the recursive intelligence model.**
> "The recursive loop described here -- Knowledge, Performance, and Motivation feeding into each other -- requires a specific cognitive capacity that only conscious systems possess: the ability to induce general theories from particular observations (cognitive learning), as distinct from reinforcement learning. For the mechanism underlying this capacity, see [Gruber, 2026, Four-Model Theory]."

**Location 2: When arguing that consciousness enables qualitatively different intelligence.**
> "The four-model architecture (Gruber, 2026) provides the mechanistic basis for this claim: the Explicit World Model (EWM) and Explicit Self Model (ESM) enable third-person perspective simulation, which is the prerequisite for observational learning and theory induction. Without these explicit models, intelligence is restricted to reinforcement learning -- a fundamentally different, non-recursive process."

**Location 3: When discussing why current AI lacks genuine intelligence.**
> "Current AI systems, including large language models, approximate cognitive learning through pattern extraction from training data but lack the real-time self-simulation that enables genuine perspective-taking and theory induction (Gruber, 2026). This architectural limitation constrains them to a sophisticated form of reinforcement learning rather than the recursive, self-amplifying intelligence loop described here."

**Location 4: When discussing the implicit/explicit knowledge distinction.**
> "The distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge maps directly onto the four-model architecture (Gruber, 2026): implicit knowledge resides in the Implicit World Model (IWM) as substrate-level stored patterns, while explicit knowledge exists in the Explicit World Model (EWM) as consciously accessible representations. This architectural grounding explains why the transition from implicit to explicit knowledge is not merely a matter of 'retrieving' stored information but requires active simulation."

### 3.2 References FROM the Consciousness Paper TO the Intelligence Paper

The consciousness paper is already submitted to *Neuroscience of Consciousness*, so adding references is only possible if revisions are requested. If the paper goes through review and revision:

**Location 1: In Section 4.2, after the cognitive learning paragraph.**
> "The implications of this cognitive-learning advantage for intelligence theory are developed in [Gruber, forthcoming], which argues that intelligence is best understood as a recursive loop (Knowledge + Performance + Motivation) enabled by the cognitive learning capacity that consciousness provides."

**Location 2: In Section 10.1 (Implications for Artificial Consciousness).**
> "The intelligence implications of this architectural specification -- including why current AI systems exhibit sophisticated pattern-matching but not recursive, self-amplifying intelligence -- are explored in [Gruber, forthcoming]."

**Location 3: In the Conclusion.**
> "The theory's implications extend beyond consciousness science into intelligence research, where the cognitive-learning capacity enabled by the four-model architecture suggests that intelligence is not a fixed trait but a recursive, self-amplifying process (Gruber, forthcoming)."

## 4. The Bridge: Cognitive-vs-RL Learning in Both Papers

This is the critical overlap. The cognitive-vs-RL distinction is the *bridge* between the two papers, and it must be framed differently in each to avoid redundancy.

### 4.1 In the Consciousness Paper: Mechanism and Architecture
The consciousness paper should treat cognitive learning as a **consequence** of the four-model architecture -- one of its predictions/implications. The focus should be:
- *What* enables cognitive learning: the EWM + ESM architecture specifically.
- *How* it works mechanistically: third-person perspective simulation via ESM redirection.
- *Why* it matters for consciousness theory: it addresses the causal-role requirement (Requirement 7).
- The mushroom example serves as a compact illustration, not the main argument.

**Current status:** This is already how the consciousness paper treats it (Section 4.2, lines 296-298). No changes needed.

### 4.2 In the Intelligence Paper: Implications for Intelligence Models
The intelligence paper should treat cognitive learning as a **premise** -- something that consciousness provides, as established in the consciousness paper -- and then develop its implications for understanding intelligence:
- *What cognitive learning enables*: the recursive Knowledge-Performance-Motivation loop.
- *Why current intelligence models fail*: they measure the outputs of a recursive process as if they were static traits.
- *Why motivation is the missing third component*: motivation is what keeps the recursive loop iterating, and without it, even high-performance, high-knowledge systems stall.
- *Why the recursive loop needs external fuel*: the loop is not self-sufficient; it requires access to new knowledge (the author's biography demonstrates this -- the loop stalled when he ran out of books at age 11).
- The mushroom example should be referenced briefly ("see Gruber, 2026, for the mechanistic basis") rather than re-presented in full.

### 4.3 Framing Rule
- **Consciousness paper:** "Consciousness enables cognitive learning." (mechanism-level claim)
- **Intelligence paper:** "Cognitive learning enables recursive intelligence." (implication-level claim)

The two papers share a causal chain: Four-model architecture -> consciousness -> cognitive learning -> recursive intelligence. The consciousness paper covers the left half; the intelligence paper covers the right half. The bridge (cognitive learning) appears in both but as an endpoint in one and a starting point in the other.

## 5. Strategic Considerations

### 5.1 Submission Timing
- The consciousness paper is already submitted to *Neuroscience of Consciousness* (2026-02-13) and is under review.
- The intelligence paper should be written and submitted to *New Ideas in Psychology* **after** the consciousness paper is accepted (or at least after a favorable first review), for several reasons:
  1. The intelligence paper cites the consciousness paper. If the consciousness paper is published or accepted, the citation is stronger than "forthcoming."
  2. A published consciousness paper provides credibility when submitting to a different journal as an independent researcher.
  3. If the consciousness paper is rejected, the intelligence paper can be revised to be more self-contained before submission.

- **However:** If NoC review takes the expected 6 weeks, and the intelligence paper takes 2-4 weeks to write, the author could begin writing immediately and submit once the NoC decision arrives. This parallelizes the work without introducing timing risk.

### 5.2 Reference Strategy
- **If consciousness paper is accepted before intelligence paper submission:** Cite it as "Gruber (2026)" with the journal reference.
- **If consciousness paper is still under review:** Cite it as "Gruber (submitted)" or "Gruber (under review)." *New Ideas in Psychology* accepts this. Include the full reference with "Manuscript submitted for publication."
- **If consciousness paper is on arXiv:** Cite the arXiv preprint. This is the strongest intermediate option, as it is publicly accessible and has a DOI.

### 5.3 Credibility Impact
Submitting both papers **strengthens** the author's credibility, provided they are in different journals and address clearly different questions:
- Paper 1 (*Neuroscience of Consciousness*): neuroscience/philosophy of mind. "What is consciousness and how does it work?"
- Paper 2 (*New Ideas in Psychology*): theoretical psychology. "What is intelligence and why do current models fail to capture it?"
- The shared author and shared theoretical framework is a **feature**, not a bug. It demonstrates that the theory has explanatory reach across domains -- exactly what a unifying framework should do.
- Having two papers in two different well-regarded journals in different subfields is a legitimate publication strategy. It is how theoretical frameworks are normally introduced: a core paper and then application papers.

### 5.4 Journal Fit
*New Ideas in Psychology* is an excellent fit for the intelligence paper:
- It explicitly welcomes "new theoretical ideas" and "critical discussions of existing theories."
- It does not require original empirical data.
- It has published critiques of intelligence models before.
- The recursive intelligence loop, the critique of g-factor/IQ, and the motivation-as-missing-component argument are all squarely within its scope.
- The biographical element (the author's own recursive loop) is more acceptable here than in a hard-science journal.

## 6. Self-Plagiarism Risk Assessment

### 6.1 Areas of Genuine Risk

**The cognitive-vs-RL learning argument.** This appears in both papers and includes the same core example (poisonous mushroom). If a reviewer of the intelligence paper happens to also review or read the consciousness paper, they will notice the overlap.

**Mitigation:**
- In the intelligence paper, do NOT reproduce the mushroom example at length. Instead, write: "Cognitive learning -- the induction of general theories from particular observations, as opposed to reinforcement learning -- requires the explicit models that consciousness provides (Gruber, 2026). The mechanism is detailed elsewhere; what matters here is the implication for intelligence models: cognitive learning is what makes the recursive loop possible."
- This converts a potential self-plagiarism concern into a proper citation.

### 6.2 Areas of Low Risk

**The four-model architecture.** This is background theory in the intelligence paper, not its main contribution. Citing it is standard practice, like citing your own earlier work on methodology.

**Emergence.** Both papers use emergence, but for different purposes (consciousness emergence vs. intelligence emergence). The concept is common intellectual property of science; no one owns it.

**Recursion.** Self-reference and recursion are used differently in each paper (self-modeling depth vs. knowledge-performance-motivation feedback). The structural parallel is interesting but not plagiaristic.

**Substrate independence and AI implications.** Both papers discuss AI, but from different angles (conscious AI vs. intelligent AI). The overlap is natural and expected.

### 6.3 The "Two Papers from One Book" Problem

Both papers derive from the same 2015 German book. A sharp reviewer might notice this and ask whether the author is simply breaking a single book into multiple papers for publication inflation.

**Mitigation:**
- The consciousness paper stands entirely on its own. It does not reference the intelligence argument.
- The intelligence paper must be written as a genuine contribution to intelligence theory, not as "Chapter 3.6 of my German book expanded." It should engage seriously with the contemporary intelligence literature (Cattell, Horn, Carroll, Sternberg, Gardner, Dweck's growth mindset, etc.) and position the recursive loop model as a novel theoretical contribution.
- The German book should be cited transparently: "This model was first proposed in [Gruber, 2015, in German] and is developed here in its first English-language presentation, with significant theoretical extensions."
- The intelligence paper should contain substantial material NOT in the German book: engagement with post-2015 literature (especially Dweck, Duckworth's grit research, Flynn effect discussions, recent AI intelligence debates), the explicit comparison with Gardner/Sternberg/CHC models, and the formal argument that motivation is systematically excluded from intelligence models.

### 6.4 Overall Risk Level: LOW

The two papers address different questions in different fields for different journals. The overlap is a single shared argument (cognitive-vs-RL learning) that can be managed through proper citation and differential framing. The risk is well within normal academic practice for an author developing a theoretical framework across domains.

## Summary of Recommendations

1. **Write the intelligence paper now**, in parallel with NoC review. Do not wait.
2. **Cite the consciousness paper** as "submitted" or by arXiv preprint.
3. **Frame cognitive-vs-RL learning differently**: mechanism in Paper 1, implication in Paper 2.
4. **Do not reproduce the mushroom example** in the intelligence paper; cite it.
5. **Engage extensively** with the post-2015 intelligence literature to make Paper 2 a genuine original contribution.
6. **Use the author's biography** as a case study in Paper 2 -- it is appropriate for *New Ideas in Psychology* and demonstrates the recursive loop.
7. **Cite the German book transparently** as the common origin, with clear statement of what is new.
8. **Submit Paper 2 after Paper 1 decision** if possible; if not, submit with "under review" citation.
9. **If Paper 1 receives revision requests**, add forward references to the intelligence paper.
