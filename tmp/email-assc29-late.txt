Subject: ASSC 29 — Late Abstract Submission Inquiry

Dear ASSC 29 Organizing Committee,

I am writing to inquire whether late abstract submissions are still being considered for ASSC 29 in Santiago. I recognize the February 12 deadline has passed, and I apologize for the late inquiry.

I would like to submit an abstract on the Four-Model Theory of Consciousness (FMT), a computational framework that addresses all eight requirements for a theory of consciousness — from the Hard Problem through the Meta-Problem — by proposing that qualia exist only in the brain's simulation, not in its substrate. The theory offers nine testable predictions and is directly relevant to the COGITATE results, providing a unifying alternative where both IIT and GNW were found incomplete. The paper is currently under review at Neuroscience of Consciousness, with a preprint on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18669891).

Specifically, I would like to ask:

1. Is late submission still possible, or is there a late-breaking poster session?
2. Are virtual or remote presentation options available? Family and health circumstances make international travel infeasible for me at this time, but I would very much like to contribute to the conference if remote participation is possible.

I am happy to present as a poster or talk.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Matthias Gruber
