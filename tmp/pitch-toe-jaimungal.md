Hi Curt,

I've been following Theories of Everything for a while — your willingness to go deep into the technical details rather than staying at the pop-sci level is exactly why I'm reaching out.

I've developed the "Four-Model Theory" (FMT) of consciousness — a computational framework that identifies the Hard Problem as a category error and makes nine experimentally falsifiable predictions. The theory bridges neuroscience (Seth, Tononi), physics ('t Hooft, Wolfram), and philosophy of mind (Metzinger, Dennett) in a single architecture.

The core idea: The brain runs four models in parallel — two unconscious (learned) and two conscious (simulated), for both the world and the self. Qualia exist only in the simulation, not in the neural substrate. This isn't Bostrom's simulation hypothesis — the substrate is real neurons, no external simulator. The Hard Problem dissolves because it was asking the wrong question: looking for qualia in the wrong layer.

What might make this a good TOE episode:

- **Physics connection:** The theory uses 't Hooft's holographic principle and Wolfram's computational classification (Class 4 cellular automata / edge-of-chaos dynamics) as foundational building blocks — consciousness requires a specific computational regime
- **Falsifiable predictions:** Nine specific, experimentally testable predictions about brain dynamics — not philosophical hand-waving
- **AI consciousness:** The theory specifies exactly what architecture a system would need to be conscious — and why current LLMs don't qualify. I'm actively working on building it
- **Unification angle:** FMT explains psychedelics, sleep, anesthesia, and meditation from a single mechanism — the balance between unconscious substrate and conscious simulation
- **Adversarial Collaboration context:** The IIT vs. GWT collaboration (2023/24) produced mixed results for both leading theories. FMT addresses phenomena that remained open in that debate

Two scientific papers are currently under peer review. The full consciousness paper is freely available as a preprint (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18669891), and a companion paper on intelligence is on PsyArXiv (https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg).

Background: Biomedical engineer, R&D AI Transformation Manager in industry, independent consciousness researcher for over two decades. My uncle Bruno J. Gruber (theoretical physicist — quantum mechanics, symmetries) shaped the symmetry-based approach. Not an academic, not affiliated with a university — just someone who figured out a testable answer and is putting it through the scientific process.

Would you be interested in a conversation?

**Note**: Personalized for TOE's technically rigorous audience. Emphasis on physics foundations, falsifiability, and unification — matches Curt's style.
