## Abstract

The COGITATE adversarial collaboration tested predictions of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) using fMRI, MEG, and iEEG in 256 participants. Neither theory emerged unscathed: IIT's predicted sustained posterior synchronization was not found, and GNWT's predicted ignition at stimulus offset was absent. I argue that both failures point to the same gap: neither theory treats the substrate's dynamical regime as a variable. The Four-Model Theory of consciousness (Gruber, 2015, 2026), which requires criticality — edge-of-chaos dynamics — as a physical prerequisite for consciousness, predicted in 2015 that neither integration measures nor broadcasting mechanisms would be the decisive marker. The COGITATE results are consistent with this prediction. I propose that future adversarial collaborations should include criticality as a testable dimension.

## 1. What COGITATE Found

The COGITATE consortium (2025) tested three pre-registered predictions each from IIT and GNWT across seven laboratories, measuring neural responses to suprathreshold visual stimuli of variable duration. The results challenged both theories. For IIT, the predicted sustained synchronization within posterior cortex — the signature that network connectivity specifies consciousness — was not found. For GNWT, the predicted "ignition" at stimulus offset and robust representation of conscious content in prefrontal cortex were absent or substantially weaker than expected. Content-related information appeared in visual, ventrotemporal, and inferior frontal cortex; sustained duration-tracking appeared in occipital and lateral temporal cortex. Neither the posterior-only pattern (IIT) nor the frontoparietal broadcasting pattern (GNWT) was confirmed in its pre-registered form.

The collaboration's architects deserve recognition for subjecting major theories to genuine falsification risk — Melloni's remark that "true progress comes from making theories vulnerable to falsification, not protecting them" captures the spirit precisely. But the experimental design, by necessity, tested only two theories. The question I wish to raise is whether the equivocal results point toward a dimension that neither IIT nor GNWT foreground: the substrate's dynamical regime.

## 2. A Missing Variable: The Dynamical Regime of the Substrate

IIT asks *how much* information a system integrates (Φ). GNWT asks *how widely* information is broadcast. Both treat the physical substrate's dynamics as a background condition rather than a variable. Neither theory makes explicit predictions about what happens when the substrate's dynamical regime changes — when criticality is disrupted, restored, or modulated.

The Four-Model Theory (FMT; Gruber, 2015, 2026) proposes that consciousness consists of real-time self-simulation across two kinds of model — implicit (substrate-level, non-conscious) and explicit (simulated, phenomenal) — organized along two dimensions: scope (world vs. self) and mode (implicit vs. explicit). Crucially, FMT imposes a physical prerequisite: the substrate must operate at or near the edge of chaos — Wolfram's (2002) Class 4 computational regime. Below this threshold, no amount of integration or broadcasting produces consciousness; above it (in the chaotic regime), coherent simulation is impossible.

This criticality requirement was derived in 2015 from Wolfram's computational universality framework, not from empirical neuroscience. It was a theoretical prediction: consciousness requires Class 4 dynamics because only this regime supports the sustained, coherent, yet flexible computation needed for real-time self-simulation. A decade later, the empirical criticality program independently confirmed the link: Hengen and Shew (2025) synthesized evidence from 140 datasets showing that consciousness tracks criticality across pharmacological, pathological, and physiological state changes. The Consciousness and Criticality (ConCrit) framework (Algom & Shriki, 2026) formalized this convergence.

## 3. Why the COGITATE Results Are Consistent with a Criticality-Based Theory

Consider the COGITATE findings through a criticality lens:

**Posterior synchronization (IIT's prediction).** IIT predicted sustained synchronization in posterior cortex as the signature of integrated information. FMT predicts no such thing. In the FMT framework, posterior regions house components of the Implicit World Model (visual cortex, ventrotemporal areas) and generate the Explicit World Model. Synchronization in these regions reflects *content generation*, not *consciousness per se*. Consciousness requires that this content generation occur within a substrate operating at criticality — synchronization is a *consequence* of critical dynamics, not its defining feature. The absence of the specific sustained synchronization pattern IIT predicted is unsurprising from this perspective: the wrong variable was being measured.

**Prefrontal ignition (GNWT's prediction).** GNWT predicted a sharp "ignition" in frontoparietal cortex at stimulus offset, reflecting global broadcasting of conscious content. FMT does not require prefrontal involvement for basic visual consciousness. The Explicit World Model is generated primarily in posterior sensory regions; prefrontal involvement reflects higher-order processing (planning, decision-making, verbal report) rather than the phenomenal core. The limited prefrontal representation found by COGITATE is consistent with a framework that locates the phenomenal core in the simulation itself, not in its broadcast.

**Content in visual and ventrotemporal cortex.** COGITATE found content-specific information primarily in visual and ventrotemporal regions. This is precisely where FMT locates the Explicit World Model — the real-time simulation of perceived reality. These regions generate the virtual world in which visual experience occurs. The finding that content is *there*, robustly, while frontal representations are weak, aligns with a theory that places the phenomenal core at the simulation level rather than at the broadcasting level.

**Duration-tracking in occipital and lateral temporal cortex.** Sustained activity tracking stimulus duration appeared in posterior regions, not in a global workspace. FMT predicts this: the Explicit World Model must persist as long as the stimulus is present, and it is generated in sensory regions. Duration-tracking is a property of the simulation, not of a broadcasting mechanism.

## 4. What the Next Adversarial Collaboration Should Test

I propose that future adversarial collaborations include criticality as an explicit test dimension. Specifically:

**Prediction 1 (from FMT, Gruber 2015, 2026): All anesthetics converge on criticality disruption.** Despite diverse receptor-level mechanisms (GABAergic, NMDA, opioid, α2-adrenergic), all agents that abolish consciousness should push the substrate below the criticality threshold. Agents that alter but preserve consciousness (ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses, low-dose psychedelics) should maintain criticality. This can be tested by measuring criticality indicators — Perturbational Complexity Index (Casali et al., 2013), Lempel-Ziv complexity, power-law exponents — across the full pharmacological range. The prediction is falsifiable: if any agent abolishes consciousness while criticality is maintained, or preserves consciousness while criticality is disrupted, the prediction fails.

**Prediction 2: Criticality is the unifying variable across IIT and GNWT findings.** Re-analyze the COGITATE dataset for criticality signatures. If consciousness-related neural activity (the portions that both theories agree reflect conscious processing) correlates with criticality measures better than with either Φ-related integration or ignition-related broadcasting, this would support a criticality-based framework. This re-analysis requires no new data collection — only the application of criticality metrics to the existing multimodal dataset.

**Prediction 3: Psychedelic ego dissolution content tracks sensory input.** FMT's most distinctive prediction — that during ego dissolution, the identity content of the altered experience tracks dominant sensory input — provides a clean test that neither IIT nor GNWT generates. Design a controlled study: administer ego-dissolution-inducing doses under conditions varying the dominant sensory environment. If identity content systematically follows input, this supports the redirectable Explicit Self Model mechanism; if identity content is random regardless of input, this specific prediction fails.

## 5. The Broader Lesson

The COGITATE results suggest that consciousness science may be searching at the wrong level of analysis. IIT asks about the *amount* of information integration; GNWT asks about the *extent* of information sharing. Both are asking "what does the system do with information?" FMT asks a prior question: "In what dynamical regime is the system operating?" If the answer is "at criticality," then specific integration and broadcasting patterns follow as consequences. If the answer is "not at criticality," then no amount of integration or broadcasting produces consciousness.

This is not to diminish IIT or GNWT — both have driven enormous empirical progress, and the adversarial collaboration model is a genuine methodological advance. The point is that the equivocal COGITATE results may be equivocal precisely because both theories share a common blind spot: they take the substrate's dynamical regime for granted.

A theory that begins with the substrate's dynamical regime — that treats criticality as the foundational prerequisite rather than a background assumption — generates a different set of predictions. Some of these predictions overlap with IIT and GNWT (posterior content representation, the functional importance of integration and broadcasting). Others diverge sharply (the anesthetic convergence prediction, the ego-dissolution prediction, the psychedelic-anosognosia prediction). The field would benefit from including criticality-based predictions in the next generation of adversarial collaborations.
