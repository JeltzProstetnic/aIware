**Subject:** ACU and self-model architecture — complementary frameworks?

Dear Scott,

I read your ACU preprint (v2, Zenodo) with genuine interest. As a fellow independent researcher working on consciousness theory, I was struck by how closely your self-model recruitment intensity (SMRI) formalization aligns with aspects of what I've been developing under a different architectural framing.

My framework — the Four-Model Theory (FMT) — proposes that consciousness arises from two kinds of internal models operating across two dimensions: implicit (learned/substrate-level) versus explicit (simulated/virtual), and world-directed versus self-directed. This yields a 2×2 taxonomy of model kinds: Implicit World Model (IWM), Explicit World Model (EWM), Implicit Self Model (ISM), and Explicit Self Model (ESM).

Reading your paper, I see your Level 2 self-modelling as potentially mapping onto what FMT calls ESM activation — the explicit self-model recruited under specific conditions. The convergence on self-models as the mechanism for agentive selfhood is notable.

What I think FMT adds to the picture ACU opens is the world-model dimension. Your framework elegantly explains when and why selfhood waxes and wanes, but perceptual consciousness — the felt quality of seeing, hearing, tasting — doesn't reduce easily to affective control monitoring. FMT treats perceptual qualia as the "sixth sense" of an explicit world-model simulation: a virtual representation whose phenomenal character arises precisely because it is a simulation, not a direct readout. This might complement ACU's Level 1 by specifying what that continuous baseline experience is *of*, architecturally.

I also found your Section 7 on artificial consciousness particularly relevant. FMT makes analogous architectural claims about what AC requires — specifically, that an explicit self-model interacting with an explicit world-model in a simulation is necessary, not merely sufficient task performance.

- A Recursive Intelligence Model (related): https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg

The FMT paper is also under review at Neuroscience of Consciousness. I'd welcome the chance to compare architectural intuitions — particularly whether SMRI might be derivable from FMT's ESM dynamics, and whether ACU's affective grounding could strengthen FMT's account of why explicit models feel like anything at all.

## Email 2: Lukas Kob (Pluralism paper)

**To:** lukas.kob@posteo.de
**From:** matthias@matthiasgruber.com
**Subject:** FMT as a candidate for your pluralism-within-limits framework

Dear Dr. Kob,

I read "Pluralism within limits" (with Tomáš Marvan) on PsyArXiv and found it remarkably relevant to a theoretical framework I've been developing independently. Your paper articulates desiderata for viable NCC pluralism — a two-factor framework, finite NCC kinds, systematic ordering — that closely match what my framework delivers.

The Four-Model Theory (FMT) proposes that consciousness involves two kinds of internal models (implicit/substrate-level and explicit/simulated) operating across two domains (world-directed and self-directed). This yields a 2×2 matrix of four systematically related model kinds:

- Implicit World Model (IWM) — learned environmental regularities
- Explicit World Model (EWM) — simulated perceptual experience
- Implicit Self Model (ISM) — learned bodily/agentive regularities
- Explicit Self Model (ESM) — simulated selfhood and agency

This is a two-factor architecture in your sense: the implicit models handle content encoding (your "first factor"), while the explicit simulation constitutes the consciousness-conferring mechanism (your "second factor"). The model kinds are finite (four, organized along two dimensions), and systematically ordered — precisely the "Standard Model" structure you argue a viable pluralism requires.

A few specific connections to your paper:

1. Your distinction between "one-factor" and "two-factor" views maps directly onto FMT's implicit/explicit distinction. FMT is inherently two-factor: implicit models process content, explicit models render it conscious.

2. Your concern about "principle explosion" under one-factor pluralism doesn't arise in FMT because the two dimensions (implicit/explicit × world/self) constrain the taxonomy to four kinds.

3. The "systematic ordering" you call for (Section 4, point 2) is built into FMT's matrix structure — the model kinds are related by shared dimensions, not listed arbitrarily. This enables exactly the kind of structured scientific model you compare to the periodic table.

4. Your proposal that consciousness may be a "scientific kind" rather than a natural kind is compatible with FMT's computational framing, which treats the four model kinds as functional categories without requiring a single underlying essence.

A trimmed version is currently under review at Neuroscience of Consciousness — the same journal where Kirkeby-Hinrup et al. (2025) published the Multiple Generator Hypothesis that your paper responds to.

I'd value your assessment of whether FMT satisfies the constraints you've outlined for a viable two-factor pluralism, and whether the 2×2 taxonomy provides the kind of systematic ordering that makes NCC pluralism scientifically tractable.
