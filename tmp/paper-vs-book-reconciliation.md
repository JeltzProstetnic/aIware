# Paper vs Book Reconciliation Report
Generated 2026-02-15

## Critical Fixes (Must Do Before Publication)

### 1. Epiphenomenalism Label in Book — CONTRADICTS PAPER
- **Paper** (line 338): "distinct from classical epiphenomenalism" + introduces "dual evaluation architecture"
- **Book** (line ~897): calls it "the theory's epiphenomenalist framework"
- **Fix**: Replace all "epiphenomenalist" language with "dual evaluation architecture" framing
- **Status**: FIX IN PROGRESS

### 2. Wolfram Classification: 4 Classes (Paper) vs 5 Classes (Book)
- Paper uses standard Wolfram 4-class throughout
- Book introduces modified 5-class scheme (fractals split out as Class 3, chaos renumbered to Class 5)
- Book acknowledges the divergence but paper doesn't mention it
- **Fix**: Add footnote in paper or book acknowledging the difference. This is a DISCUSSION ITEM — Matthias wants to discuss computation classes in a fresh session.

### 3. Prediction 8 Scope Mismatch
- Paper: Comprehensive sleep architecture prediction (5 sub-predictions)
- Book: Only mentions lucid dreaming threshold crossing
- **Fix**: Expand book's Prediction 8 description or note it's simplified

## Moderate Fixes

### 4. "Dual evaluation architecture" term missing from book
- Paper's key term not used in book Chapter 12 at all
- **Fix**: Adopt the term in Chapter 12

### 5. Appendix B (Intelligence) — Still TODO
- Marked as placeholder: "[TODO: Condense from paper/intelligence/paper.md]"
- **Fix**: Will be written after intelligence paper is finalized

### 6. "Don't push neurons around" — Too Blunt
- Book's free will section uses this phrasing, which reads as stronger epiphenomenalism than intended
- **Fix**: Soften to match paper's nuanced "architecture is causally efficacious; qualia lack independent causal power but are constitutive" framing

## Book Content That Could Strengthen Paper

1. **Five-level information processing hierarchy** (Physical → Electrochemical → Proteomic → Topological → Virtual)
2. **Six-layer cortical argument** (3 layers processing + 3 layers self-modeling)
3. **Cognitive learning argument** — consciousness enables learning from observation without dying
4. **Cortical automaton** as concrete mechanism (paper uses "CA" but never names it)
5. **Double dissociation framing** — Blindsight + Anton's as "substrate without simulation" vs "simulation without input"
6. **Baldwin Effect** — learned behavior creates selection pressure for more consciousness architecture

## Paper Content Missing from Book

1. **Eight-requirement framework** — paper's systematic evaluation of theories not in book
2. **Comparative scoring matrix** (Table 5) — could be simplified for book
3. **Prediction testability ratings** — book only gives brief summaries
4. **Open Question 1** — whether implicit models might themselves be virtual
5. **Emerging frameworks** — Milinkovic 2025 biological computationalism, Kirkeby-Hinrup 2025 MGH
6. **Godelian self-modeling limitation** — in paper's limitations but not book's "What I Don't Know"

## Processing Frequencies — Minor Inconsistency
- Book: unconscious ~40 Hz, conscious ~20 Hz
- Paper: conscious ~20 Hz, 500ms processing delay
- Book uses 350ms gap (Libet motor cortex timing), paper uses 500ms
- Not contradictory but should be tightened
