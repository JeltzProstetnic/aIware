Subject: A falsifiable framework volunteering for adversarial testing — from an independent researcher

Dear Professor Melloni,

COGITATE demonstrated what the field needed to hear: neither IIT nor GNW, tested head-to-head under pre-registered conditions, could fully account for the data — and posterior cortical involvement exceeded what either theory predicted. Your call for a "quantitative framework for systematic theory testing" is the most consequential methodological statement in consciousness science right now. I am writing because I have spent thirty years developing such a framework and would like to volunteer it for adversarial testing.

I am a biomedical engineer and independent researcher. My framework — the Four-Model Theory (FMT), originally published in German in 2015, now under review at Neuroscience of Consciousness — proposes that consciousness consists of real-time self-simulation organized along two dimensions: scope (world vs. self) and mode (implicit/learned vs. explicit/simulated). The implicit models are substrate-level and non-conscious; the explicit models are virtual, transient, and phenomenal. Qualia are properties of the simulation, not the substrate — dissolving the Hard Problem as a category error.

What makes FMT relevant to COGITATE specifically: it generates nine falsifiable predictions testable with the infrastructure your group already commands. Prediction 1 calls for a 2x2 factorial fMRI design crossing scope and mode, expecting a double dissociation in distributed networks. Prediction 5 states that all anesthetic agents, regardless of molecular mechanism, converge on criticality disruption. Prediction 3 — the most distinctive — claims that ego dissolution content during psychedelics tracks dominant sensory input, something no competing theory generates. These are not post-hoc accommodations; they follow from the theory's five principles and were formulated before COGITATE's results.

FMT also includes a criticality requirement derived from Wolfram's computational framework in 2015 — a decade before the 2025-2026 empirical convergence on neural criticality. Independent arrival from theoretical and empirical directions strengthens the case.

I understand you will be speaking at the "Conscious Mind at 30" conference in Bochum this June. I am planning to submit a poster abstract and would welcome the chance to discuss FMT with you in person.
