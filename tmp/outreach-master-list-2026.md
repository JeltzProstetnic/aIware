## PART 1: RESEARCHERS (17 new targets)

### Priority 1 — COGITATE Cluster (actively seeking new theories)

**1. Lucia Melloni** — Max Planck Frankfurt + NYU
- Email: lucia.melloni@ae.mpg.de
- Led COGITATE adversarial collaboration (Nature 2025) — both IIT and GWT found wanting
- Explicitly calling for "quantitative framework for systematic theory testing"
- Has fMRI, MEG, intracranial EEG
- Connection: Volunteer FMT for adversarial testing — she is literally looking for new theories
- Approachability: HIGH

**2. Liad Mudrik** — Tel Aviv University
- Email: mudrikli@tauex.tau.ac.il (likely)
- Co-led COGITATE, built ConTraSt database cataloguing empirical predictions from theories
- Two PhDs (psychology + philosophy), CIFAR fellow, trained under Christof Koch
- Connection: FMT's 9 predictions could be added to ConTraSt database
- Approachability: HIGH

**3. Megan Peters** — UC Irvine
- Email: megan.peters@uci.edu
- Twitter: @meganakpeters
- ASSC board member, president of Neuromatch (40k+ participants)
- Research on metacognition, confidence, computational modeling of awareness
- Co-founded "Fund Consciousness!" initiative
- Connection: Metacognitive confidence maps to explicit/implicit model distinction
- Approachability: VERY HIGH — most publicly accessible serious researcher on this list

**4. Michael Pitts** — Reed College
- Email: mpitts@reed.edu
- COGITATE consortium PI, specializes in separating NCC from post-perceptual processing
- Small liberal arts college = fewer competing demands
- Connection: His "perceptual awareness negativity" ERP could mark IWM-to-EWM transition
- Approachability: HIGH

**5. Hal Blumenfeld** — Yale
- Email: hal.blumenfeld@yale.edu
- COGITATE PI, consciousness impairment in epilepsy, philosophy undergrad background
- Connection: Seizures disrupting explicit models while implicit remain = FMT prediction
- Approachability: MODERATE

### Priority 2 — Self-Model Cluster

**6. Michael Graziano** — Princeton
- Email: graziano@princeton.edu
- Attention Schema Theory (AST) — self-model approach closest to FMT
- Interested in artificial consciousness, prolific public writer
- Connection: FMT's ESM generalizes his attention schema to full self-model
- Approachability: HIGH (already in Tier 1 networking plan)

**7. Georg Northoff** — University of Ottawa / Taipei Medical University
- Email: georg@theroyal.ca
- Twitter: @northoffl
- Temporo-Spatial Theory of Consciousness (TTC), spontaneous brain activity
- Book: "The Spontaneous Brain" (MIT Press)
- Connection: His "world-brain problem" is precisely what FMT answers with implicit/explicit
- Approachability: HIGH

**8. Olaf Blanke** — EPFL Switzerland
- Email: olaf.blanke@epfl.ch
- Bodily self-consciousness, out-of-body experiences, full-body illusions
- Co-defined "bodily self-consciousness" WITH Metzinger
- Connection: His illusion experiments test FMT's ISM/ESM distinction directly
- Approachability: MODERATE (major figure, but Metzinger lineage = natural connection)

**9. Catherine Tallon-Baudry** — ENS Paris
- Email: catherine.tallon-baudry@ens.psl.eu
- Gut-brain coupling, interoceptive basis of consciousness, "minimal self"
- CIFAR Brain, Mind & Consciousness fellow
- Connection: Her visceral self-monitoring = FMT's Implicit Self Model anchoring
- Approachability: MODERATE-HIGH

### Priority 3 — Criticality & Complexity Cluster

**10. Pedro Mediano** — Imperial College London
- Website: pmediano.gitlab.io
- Synergistic information processing in consciousness (eLife 2024)
- Bridges IIT and GWT using information theory
- Connection: FMT's explicit models are inherently synergistic — his tools could formalize it
- Approachability: HIGH (early career, building research program)

**11. Andrea Luppi** — Oxford/Cambridge/McGill
- Email: al857@cam.ac.uk (likely)
- Multi-state brain dynamics across anesthesia, psychedelics, sleep, coma
- Co-authored synergistic workspace paper with Mediano
- Connection: FMT makes specific predictions for each altered state he studies
- Approachability: HIGH (early career, Wellcome Fellow)

**12. Marcello Massimini** — University of Milan
- Email: marcello.massimini@unimi.it
- Invented Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI)
- Connection: PCI measures exactly what FMT's P5 predicts — criticality required for consciousness
- Approachability: MODERATE-HIGH (already in Tier 2 networking plan)

**13. Woodrow Shew** — University of Arkansas
- Physics of brain criticality, co-author with Hengen (already contacted)
- Connection: Physicist perspective on C4CA/edge-of-chaos — complementary to Hengen
- Approachability: MODERATE

### Priority 1b — Independent Convergence / AC Implementation

**14. Ryota Kanai** — Araya Inc., Tokyo (CEO/Founder)
- Email: kanair@araya.org (NOT ryota.kanai@ — that bounces)
- Information Generation Theory (2019, NoC): "consciousness is the ability to simulate internally"
- CREST-funded to build artificial consciousness
- Connection: Independent convergence — Gruber 2015 and Kanai 2019 arrived at the same core insight (consciousness = internal simulation) from different starting points. His AC goal = your AC goal.
- NOTE: Do NOT stress temporal priority. Frame as mutual validation through independent convergence.
- Approachability: HIGH (startup CEO, more accessible than academics)

**15. Hakwan Lau** — RIKEN Center for Brain Science, Japan
- Email: hakwan@gmail.com (publicly listed)
- Perceptual Reality Monitoring (PRM) theory
- Book: "In Consciousness We Trust" (OUP)
- Connection: PRM's reality-checking = FMT's EWM comparing against IWM
- Approachability: MODERATE-HIGH (building new lab at RIKEN)

### Priority 5 — Predictive Processing & Other

**16. Floris de Lange** — Radboud/Donders Institute
- Predictive Brain Lab, COGITATE member, eLife senior editor
- Connection: FMT's implicit world model IS prediction machinery
- Approachability: MODERATE

**17. Naotsugu Tsuchiya** — Monash University
- Email: Naotsugu.Tsuchiya@monash.edu
- Twitter: @NaoTsuchiya
- Cross-species consciousness testing, IIT empirical tests, Koch lab pedigree
- Connection: FMT predicts qualitative differences between implicit-only and explicit-model organisms
- Approachability: HIGH

### Note on Anil Seth
Deliberately excluded. Most visible consciousness researcher (14M TED views, NoC editor-in-chief) but overwhelmed by unsolicited theory emails. His 2025 Berggruen Prize essay "The Mythology of Conscious AI" suggests skepticism toward substrate independence. Contact AFTER building credibility through others.
