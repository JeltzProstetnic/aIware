# Self-Publishing Options for a Pop-Science Book

## The Optimal Strategy: KDP + IngramSpark + Direct Sales

For a niche pop-sci book (consciousness/neuroscience), the highest-ROI approach is a **three-pronged distribution model**: Amazon KDP for ebooks and the lion's share of online sales, IngramSpark for bookstore/library access and European print distribution, and a direct sales channel (Payhip or your own site) for maximum margin on your existing audience.[^1][^2]

Many successful indie nonfiction authors publish on both KDP and IngramSpark simultaneously — KDP handles Amazon-specific sales with better royalties, while IngramSpark feeds the Ingram catalog that bookstores and libraries actually order from.[^3][^2]

## Platform Comparison

| Platform | Formats | Ebook Royalty | Print Royalty | Setup Cost | Distribution | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Amazon KDP** | Ebook + POD | 70% ($2.99–$9.99) | 60% (≥$9.99) minus print cost | Free | Amazon global | Volume sales, ebook dominance |
| **IngramSpark** | Ebook + POD (incl. hardcover) | ~40% | 45–65% (varies by discount) | Small setup fees | 45,000+ retailers, libraries, bookstores globally | Brick-and-mortar, libraries, DACH region |
| **Draft2Digital** | Ebook + POD | 90% (takes 10% cut) | Similar | Free | Amazon, Apple, Kobo, B&N, libraries | Easy multi-retailer distribution |
| **Kobo Writing Life** | Ebook only | 70% (≥$2.99) | N/A | Free | 190 countries, strong in Canada/Europe | European ebook market |
| **Apple Books** | Ebook only | 70% (all prices) | N/A | Free (Mac required) | Apple ecosystem globally | Younger demographic |
| **Payhip/Gumroad** | Digital (PDF/EPUB) | 95–97% (minus transaction fee) | N/A | Free | Direct to consumer | Maximizing per-sale revenue |
| **Lulu** | Ebook + POD | Varies | Varies | Free | Amazon, B&N, Ingram | Simple POD, but higher print costs |

## Amazon KDP: Your Primary Channel

Amazon accounts for ~68% of global ebook sales, and 87% of indie authors report it as their top revenue source. For a pop-sci book:[^6]

- **Ebook pricing sweet spot**: $4.99–$9.99 to capture 70% royalty. Below $2.99 drops you to 35%.[^6]
- **Print (KDP Print)**: 60% royalty on books priced $9.99+, minus print cost. Cheapest per-unit printing and fastest shipping.[^6]
- **KDP Select**: Enrolling gives access to Kindle Unlimited and promotional tools, but requires Amazon ebook exclusivity for 90-day periods. For niche nonfiction, KU page reads can be a meaningful income supplement, but it locks you out of Kobo/Apple/direct sales.[^6]
- **Expanded Distribution**: Pushes your KDP Print book to non-Amazon retailers, but at 40% royalty — significantly worse than IngramSpark's wholesale terms.[^7][^3]

**Recommendation**: Use KDP for ebook + Amazon print sales. Skip KDP Select if you want to go wide (which you should for a European audience). Skip Expanded Distribution — use IngramSpark instead.[^3]

## IngramSpark: The Bookstore/Library Gateway

IngramSpark plugs you into Ingram's catalog — the same distribution network traditional publishers use. Any retailer with an Ingram account (which is essentially all of them) can order your book.[^8][^9]

### Key advantages for your use case:
- **Global Connect Program**: Print facilities in Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Brazil, India, Japan, and more — books printed locally avoid cross-border shipping costs.[^8]
- **DACH market access**: The German book market is worth €9.29 billion. IngramSpark sells hundreds of thousands of English-language titles into Germany annually. Your book would be orderable through Thalia, Amazon.de, and independent Austrian bookstores.[^8]
- **Hardcover option**: KDP only does paperback and hardcover recently, but IngramSpark has more finish/format options.[^2]
- **Library distribution**: Libraries overwhelmingly order through Ingram, not Amazon.[^6]

### The catch — DACH pricing issue:
One author reported that IngramSpark books shipped via their UK facility to Austria resulted in Thalia pricing a €16 book at €24.99 due to import duties. However, IngramSpark's German print facility (via Global Connect) should mitigate this if your book qualifies for local printing. Verify that your book specs are printable at the German facility before publishing.[^10]

### Wholesale discount strategy:
Set your IngramSpark wholesale discount to **55%** and enable returns — this is what bookstores expect. Your per-unit royalty will be lower than KDP, but the point is bookstore/library reach, not per-unit margin.[^11][^6]

## Direct Sales: Payhip or Your Own Site

Given you already have matthiasgruber.com and a technical audience, selling direct is a no-brainer for maximizing margin:

- **Payhip**: 5% transaction fee on the free plan (drops to 0% on $99/mo plan). Instant payouts, no minimums. Supports PDF + EPUB. Embeddable on your existing site.[^12][^13]
- **Gumroad**: 10% flat fee. "Pay what you want" pricing model can work well for niche intellectual content.[^14]
- **Shopify**: Overkill unless you're selling merch alongside the book.[^15]

Selling a PDF/EPUB bundle directly at $14.99 with Payhip nets you ~$14.24 per sale vs. ~$3.50 on a $9.99 KDP ebook. The tradeoff is you drive all traffic yourself.[^13]

**Recommendation**: Payhip embedded on matthiasgruber.com for direct ebook sales. Offer a "premium" bundle (ebook + supplementary materials, perhaps a consciousness model diagram set or discussion guide).

## Draft2Digital: The Easy Aggregator

If you don't want to manually manage Apple Books, Kobo, and B&N separately, Draft2Digital distributes to all of them from a single dashboard for a 10% cut. They also push to libraries via OverDrive and Bibliotheca.[^1][^6]

For a niche pop-sci title, Kobo is particularly relevant — it has a strong European presence and 70% royalties at $2.99+. Draft2Digital handles Kobo distribution without you needing a separate Kobo Writing Life account.[^6]

## Pricing Strategy for Pop-Sci Nonfiction

Based on the 2025 KDP royalty restructuring:[^6]

| Format | Recommended Price | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Kindle ebook** | $6.99–$9.99 | 70% royalty bracket; competitive for pop-sci |
| **Paperback (KDP)** | $14.99–$17.99 | 60% royalty tier ($9.99+); covers print cost with healthy margin |
| **Paperback (IngramSpark)** | $16.99–$19.99 | Accounts for 55% wholesale discount; still competitive in bookstores |
| **Hardcover (IngramSpark)** | $24.99–$29.99 | Premium format for pop-sci; credibility signal |
| **Direct ebook (Payhip)** | $12.99–$14.99 | Premium justified by bonus content; ~95% margin |

Price the Kindle ebook **below** the paperback — Amazon customers expect this. A $9.99 ebook with a $16.99 paperback is standard for pop-sci.[^6]

## Marketing Considerations for Niche Pop-Sci

### Pre-launch
- **Beta readers**: Recruit from neuroscience/consciousness communities. They become your first reviewers and street team.[^16][^17]
- **Email list**: Build on matthiasgruber.com now. Offer a free chapter or consciousness model overview as a lead magnet.[^17]
- **Author bio optimization**: For nonfiction, Amazon's "About the Author" section is critical for credibility. Your biomedical engineering background + consciousness research angle is a strong differentiator.[^6]

### Post-launch
- **Podcast circuit**: Consciousness/neuroscience/AI podcasts are your highest-leverage marketing channel. Guest appearances convert directly to sales for niche nonfiction.[^18][^17]
- **Amazon Ads**: Start with auto-targeting campaigns, then refine to competitor book titles (Giulio Tononi, Christof Koch, Anil Seth, etc.).[^2]
- **Academic/professional communities**: Cross-post in relevant forums, ResearchGate, and LinkedIn.
- **Non-fiction reader magnets**: A companion workbook, expanded chapter, or video tutorial related to the book's core thesis.[^17]

### ISBN Strategy
- Purchase your own ISBNs (available from the Austrian ISBN agency, Hauptverband des Österreichischen Buchhandels). This makes **you** the publisher of record, not Amazon or IngramSpark. Costs ~€70 for 10 ISBNs in Austria.
- Use the same ISBN for IngramSpark and your direct sales. Use a different ISBN (or Amazon's free one) for KDP Print, since KDP and IngramSpark shouldn't share the same print ISBN.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. **Write and finalize manuscript** → professional developmental edit + copy edit (Reedsy marketplace for freelancers)[^6]
2. **Cover design** → hire a designer experienced in pop-sci (think Anil Seth / Carlo Rovelli aesthetic)
3. **Purchase ISBNs** from Austrian agency
4. **Set up KDP account** → upload ebook + paperback
5. **Set up IngramSpark** → upload paperback + hardcover with 55% wholesale discount, returns enabled
6. **Set up Draft2Digital** → distribute ebook to Apple, Kobo, B&N, libraries
7. **Set up Payhip** on matthiasgruber.com → premium ebook bundle
8. **Launch sequence**: Email list → podcast appearances → Amazon Ads → social proof accumulation

This structure maximizes reach (Amazon + bookstores + libraries + direct) while keeping your per-sale economics strong across every channel.[^1][^2][^8][^6]
