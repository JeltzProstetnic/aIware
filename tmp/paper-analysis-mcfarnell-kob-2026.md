# Analysis: McFarnell (2026) & Kob & Marvan (2026) — Relevance to FMT

## Paper 1: McFarnell — "Affective Control under Uncertainty: A Two-Level Theory of Consciousness"

**Author:** Scott McFarnell, Independent Researcher, UK
**Contact:** scott.mcfarnell.research@gmail.com | ORCID 0009-0000-6703-190X
**Date:** February 2026 (v2) | Zenodo preprint
**Length:** 32 pages, ~10,000 words + refs

### Core Claims

ACU proposes two levels:
- **Level 1 — Affective Control Awareness**: Baseline consciousness = felt monitoring of regulatory viability. Always on during wakefulness. Grounded in interoception (insula), subcortical affect (PAG, amygdala), and control monitoring (ACC). NOT the same as selfhood.
- **Level 2 — Self-Modelling under Uncertainty**: Transient selfhood recruited when competing action policies diverge in affective stakes under time pressure. Formalized as SMRI = H(π) · σ²(V) · f(T_constraint). Engages mPFC, PCC, TPJ.

### 8 Falsifiable Predictions
1. ACC activation tracks entropy × affective variance interaction (not prediction error alone)
2. mPFC peaks at commitment, deactivates during execution
3. Anhedonia impairs Level 2 disproportionately
4. Sedation impairs Level 2 before Level 1
5. Mirror self-recognition predicts future-oriented decision-making
6. Consciousness markers correlate with ecological unpredictability, not brain size
7. Depersonalization = preserved Level 1, disrupted Level 2
8. AI self-models emerge only under conjunction of competing objectives + irreversible actions + viability constraints

### Key Strengths
- Very well-written, clear structure, proper falsification criteria
- Solid neuroscience grounding (Craig, Panksepp, Shenhav, Friston)
- Addresses AC directly with architectural requirements (Section 7)
- 8 specific, testable predictions — rare for a consciousness theory paper
- Published Feb 2026 — extremely current

### Overlap with FMT

| FMT concept | ACU equivalent | Alignment |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Self-model (ISM/ESM) | Level 2 self-modelling | **Strong** — both center consciousness on self-models |
| Implicit vs explicit | Level 1 vs Level 2 | **Partial** — FMT's implicit/explicit is about model type, ACU's is about consciousness level |
| World model (IWM/EWM) | **ABSENT** | ACU has no world-model dimension — only self + affect |
| Qualia as virtual sense | Not addressed | ACU treats qualia as "what control feels like" |
| Simulation architecture | Not present | ACU is control-theoretic, not simulationist |
| 2×2 matrix of model kinds | Absent — only 2 levels | FMT is richer in taxonomy |

### Critical Differences

1. **No world model**: ACU is entirely self/affect-focused. FMT's world model dimension (IWM/EWM) has no counterpart. This is a significant gap — ACU cannot explain perceptual consciousness (seeing red) except as "affective monitoring."

2. **Affect as foundation**: ACU makes affect *constitutive* of consciousness. FMT treats affect as one component within the simulation, not the foundation.

3. **No simulation**: ACU stays within predictive processing / active inference. FMT proposes the brain runs a virtual simulation — a much stronger architectural claim.

4. **Scope**: ACU explains when/why selfhood waxes and wanes. FMT explains the *architecture* of conscious experience (what is being simulated and how).

5. **Formalization**: ACU provides a concrete formula (SMRI). FMT's formalization is in progress (paper 4).

### Assessment for Outreach

**HIGH VALUE target.** McFarnell is:
- Independent researcher (like Matthias — no institutional gatekeeping)
- Working on self-models + consciousness + AC
- Publishing on Zenodo (same platform)
- His theory is *complementary* to FMT, not competing
- ACU's Level 2 could be FMT's ESM activation
- ACU's missing world-model dimension is exactly what FMT provides

**Angle:** "Your Level 2 self-modelling may be a special case of what we call the Explicit Self Model (ESM). But FMT also provides a world-model dimension that ACU lacks — which may explain perceptual consciousness that your framework relegates to 'affective monitoring.'"

## Paper 2: Kob & Marvan — "Pluralism within limits: How to make the idea of multiple NCC kinds useful"

**Authors:** Lukas Kob (Magdeburg/Czech Academy) & Tomáš Marvan (Czech Academy)
**Contact:** lukas.kob@posteo.de | ORCID 0000-0002-7704-4373
**Date:** February 19, 2026 | PsyArXiv preprint
**Length:** 25 pages, 7,525 words

### Core Argument

Responds to Kirkeby-Hinrup et al. (2025) "Multiple Generator Hypothesis" (published in *Neuroscience of Consciousness*). Analyzes when NCC pluralism is viable:

1. **One-factor vs two-factor**: One-factor theories (content + consciousness mechanism inseparable, e.g. IIT) lead to "principle explosion" under pluralism — each content type needs its own consciousness mechanism. This is unscientific. Two-factor theories (content encoding separate from consciousness-conferring mechanism) are required for viable pluralism.

2. **Constraints on pluralism**: NCC kinds must be (a) finite in number, (b) systematically ordered (not a random list), (c) compatible with consciousness as a unified kind.

3. **Scientific vs natural kind**: Proposes consciousness may be better understood as a *scientific kind* (like "planet") rather than a *natural kind* (like "gold"). This allows multiple mechanistic implementations without requiring shared essence.

### Key Claims

- Pluralism is viable ONLY under two-factor theories with a manageable number of consciousness principles
- The principles should be systematically related (like a periodic table or standard model)
- Strong pluralism (multiple NCC *kinds*) is more interesting than weak pluralism (one principle, multiple locations)
- References Biyu He (2023) — someone you've already contacted!
- Published in a space directly adjacent to FMT's terrain

### Overlap with FMT

| Kob & Marvan concept | FMT equivalent | Alignment |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Two-factor framework (content vs consciousness mechanism) | FMT's implicit (content) vs explicit (simulation) | **Strong** — FMT IS a two-factor theory |
| Finite, systematically ordered NCC kinds | FMT's 2×2 matrix | **Perfect fit** — FMT provides exactly the "systematic ordering" they call for |
| "Standard Model" analogy for consciousness principles | FMT's taxonomy | FMT literally proposes a structured taxonomy of model kinds |
| Consciousness as scientific kind | Compatible with FMT | FMT doesn't require consciousness to be a natural kind |
| Multiple NCC kinds that are systematically related | IWM/EWM/ISM/ESM as ordered model kinds | **Direct match** |

### Critical Assessment

This paper is essentially **calling for exactly what FMT provides**. Kob & Marvan argue that:
- We need a two-factor framework ✓ (FMT has implicit/explicit)
- NCC kinds must be finite ✓ (FMT: 2×2 = 4 model kinds)
- NCC kinds must be systematically ordered ✓ (FMT: ordered by implicit/explicit × world/self dimensions)
- We need something like a "Standard Model" for consciousness ✓ (FMT's taxonomy)

The paper doesn't propose a theory — it sets up the *desiderata* that a theory needs to meet. FMT meets them.

### Assessment for Outreach

**EXTREMELY HIGH VALUE.** This is practically an invitation for FMT:
- They're at the Czech Academy of Sciences (Kob also at Magdeburg)
- They cite Kirkeby-Hinrup et al. (2025) in *Neuroscience of Consciousness* — the same journal where your trimmed paper is under review
- They cite Biyu He (2023) — you've already emailed her
- They cite the COGITATE consortium (Melloni et al. 2025) — Melloni will be at Bochum
- Lukas Kob has his own paper in *Philosophy and the Mind Sciences* (Kob 2025) on structuralism and two-factor approaches

**Angle:** "You argue that viable NCC pluralism requires a two-factor framework with a finite, systematically ordered set of consciousness principles. FMT provides exactly this: a 2×2 matrix crossing implicit/explicit with world/self, yielding four systematically related model kinds. This is the 'Standard Model' structure you call for."

## Strategic Summary

Both papers strengthen the case for FMT outreach:

| Paper | Relationship to FMT | Priority |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| McFarnell (ACU) | Complementary theory — covers affect/selfhood but misses world models | High |
| Kob & Marvan | Sets desiderata that FMT fulfills | Very high |

**Kob & Marvan is the stronger outreach target** because they're asking for exactly what FMT offers. McFarnell is interesting because he's a fellow independent researcher working on overlapping territory.

Both papers are from Feb 2026 — responding quickly signals you're active in the field.
