## Abstract (~250 words)

- **Problem**: No existing theory of consciousness satisfies all eight core requirements simultaneously (Hard Problem, Explanatory Gap, Boundary, Structure, Unity/Binding, Combination/Emergence, Causal Role, Meta-Problem).
- **Theory**: Present the Four-Model Theory — consciousness as real-time self-simulation across four nested models (Implicit World Model, Implicit Self Model, Explicit World Model, Explicit Self Model) operating at criticality.
- **Key claim**: Qualia are virtual — a "sixth sense" of the simulation, not a property of the physical substrate. This dissolves rather than solves the Hard Problem.
- **Results**: The theory scores strong on all eight requirements, yields eight novel testable predictions, and unifies a wide range of phenomena (psychedelics, anesthesia, dreams, split-brain, DID, animal consciousness) from five principles.
- **Convergence highlight**: The theory's criticality requirement, derived independently from Wolfram's computational framework (2015), converges with the empirical ConCrit framework (2025) — a decade-apart independent validation.

## 1. Introduction (~1,500 words)

### 1.1 The Pre-Paradigm State
- Consciousness science lacks a dominant paradigm (Kuhn)
- Multiple competing theories: IIT, GNW, HOT, PP, AST, RPT, CEMI, etc.
- COGITATE results (Nature, 2025): Neither IIT nor GNW fully confirmed. Posterior cortex favored over both camps' core predictions.
- IIT pseudoscience controversy (Nature Neuroscience, 2025) — theoretical crisis
- Growing recognition that current frameworks may be insufficient (Frontiers 2025 reviews)

### 1.2 What Would Count as Progress?
- Define the 8 requirements any complete theory must meet (preview — full treatment in §2)
- Argue that no existing theory passes all eight
- State the paper's contribution: a theory that does, with testable predictions

### 1.3 Overview of the Four-Model Theory
- Brief historical context: Originally published in German (Gruber, 2015), refined through adversarial challenge (2026)
- Self-described as: MDM (Dennett) + SMT (Metzinger) + neural network architecture
- Substrate-independent — six-layer cortex as evolutionary accident, not requirement
- Paper structure preview

## 2. Eight Requirements for a Theory of Consciousness (~2,000 words)

Establish the evaluation framework before presenting the theory. Each requirement gets:
- Definition (what the requirement asks)
- Why it matters (what goes wrong without it)
- How existing theories fare (brief — detailed comparison in §7)

### 2.1 The Hard Problem (Chalmers, 1995)
Why does physical processing give rise to subjective experience? Why isn't it all "in the dark"?

### 2.2 The Explanatory Gap (Levine, 1983)
Even if we identify all neural correlates, why does the explanation feel incomplete?

### 2.3 The Boundary Problem
Where does the conscious system end? What delineates conscious from non-conscious processing within the brain?

### 2.4 Structure of Experience
Consciousness is not a blob — it has rich structure (spatial, temporal, modal). How does physical processing produce structured experience?

### 2.5 Unity and Binding
How are distributed neural processes unified into a single coherent experience?

### 2.6 Combination and Emergence
How do non-conscious elements combine to produce consciousness? (The combination problem for panpsychism; the emergence problem for physicalism.)

### 2.7 Causal Role
Does consciousness do anything? If so, what? If not, why does it exist?

### 2.8 The Meta-Problem (Chalmers, 2018)
Why do we *think* there is a hard problem? Why do humans report that consciousness seems mysterious?

## 3. The Four-Model Theory (~3,000 words)

Core theory presentation. This is the heart of the paper.

### 3.1 Core Definition
Consciousness is the ability of an entity to create a model of itself, relate that model to itself, and interact with it. It is a process, not a property.

### 3.2 The Four Models
Present the 2×2 architecture:

| | Everything (world) | Self only |
|---|---|---|
| **Implicit** (learned, substrate) | IWM | ISM |
| **Explicit** (simulated, phenomenal) | EWM | ESM |

- IWM: Total accumulated knowledge in synaptic weights. Never conscious.
- ISM: Self-knowledge (body schema, skills, personality). Never directly conscious.
- EWM: The conscious world — real-time simulation. Where experience lives.
- ESM: The conscious self — real-time "I." Who you are.

### 3.3 The Real/Virtual Split
- Real side (IWM + ISM): Physical, structural, no experience.
- Virtual side (EWM + ESM): Simulated, transient, phenomenal.
- The transistor/Windows analogy
- Key properties: virtual models are software-like (forkable, clonable, redirectable)

### 3.4 Virtual Qualia — Dissolving the Hard Problem
**The central insight.** Qualia are a virtual "sixth sense" — the way the ESM perceives its own states within the EWM.

- The substrate does NOT feel. The simulation does.
- "Why does firing feel like something?" is a category error. The firing doesn't feel. The simulation does, and qualia are constitutive within it.
- Not illusionism (Dennett/Frankish): qualia are real within the simulation. Two-level ontology.
- Not property dualism: both levels are physical. Process physicalism.

### 3.5 Graduated Levels
- Basic consciousness → Simply extended → Doubly extended → Triply extended
- Each level = additional recursive self-modeling layer
- Continuum, not binary threshold

### 3.6 The Implicit-Explicit Boundary
- Selectively permeable in normal waking
- Variable permeability as a key mechanism (see §6: Explanatory Range)
- Information becomes conscious when transferred from ISM → EWM

### 3.7 Criticality Requirement
- Substrate must operate in Wolfram's Class 4 regime (edge of chaos)
- Class 1/2 → no consciousness; Class 3 → no coherent consciousness; Class 4 → consciousness
- Independent derivation from Wolfram (2015), converging with ConCrit (2025)
- Criticality as the *physical* threshold; four-model architecture as the *functional* threshold

### 3.8 The ESM is Redirectable
- Virtual self-model needs input. Disrupt normal input → ESM latches onto whatever dominates.
- Key mechanism for psychedelics, salvia, Cotard's, confabulation.
- Not a bug but a feature: reveals the virtual/software nature of consciousness.

---

## 4. Philosophical Commitments (~1,500 words)

### 4.1 Process Physicalism
Qualia are higher-order physical patterns. Not a separate substance, not a fundamental property, but an emergent pattern at the virtual level. Compatible with physicalism but requires the real/virtual distinction.

### 4.2 Epiphenomenalism
- Consciousness observes but does not cause.
- The architecture is causally efficacious; consciousness is the ride-along.
- Free will as illusion: the simulation narrates decisions already made at the substrate level.
- **Anticipated objection**: If epiphenomenal, why does consciousness exist?
  - Answer: It's a side effect of running the self-simulation, which IS adaptive (the architecture causes behavior; consciousness tags along).
  - The *process* is selected for; the *experience* is a necessary accompaniment.
- **Defense section**: Address the standard anti-epiphenomenalist arguments (zombie argument, knowledge argument, evolutionary argument). Show that virtual qualia framework sidesteps each.

### 4.3 Weak Emergence
Consciousness is deducible in principle from substrate physics. No strong emergence, no magical threshold, no panpsychist combination.

### 4.4 Substrate Independence
Six-layer cortex is evolutionary accident. Any substrate implementing the four-model architecture at criticality should produce consciousness. Corvids/cephalopods as biological evidence.

### 4.5 Entailments
- Quantum measurement: consciousness plays no role (entailment of epiphenomenalism)
- No Cartesian theater: ISM is never conscious
- No homunculus: ESM is a projection, not a viewer

## 5. Binding and Criticality (~1,500 words)

### 5.1 Binding as Emergent Property
- Not a separate mechanism but a consequence of critical dynamics
- Distributed representations (standard NN property), formalized as attractor dynamics
- Holographic storage: cutting connections degrades but does not destroy

### 5.2 The Criticality Framework
- Wolfram's four classes of computation
- Beggs & Plenz (2003) → Carhart-Harris (2014) → **Gruber (2015)** → ConCrit (2025)
- Timeline showing independent convergence (10-year prediction)
- The criticality threshold maps directly to consciousness states (table)

### 5.3 Consciousness States Derived from Criticality
| State | Criticality level | Consciousness prediction | Empirical evidence |
|-------|---|---|---|
| Waking | At/near critical | Full | PCI, EEG complexity |
| REM | Near-critical, input-starved | Degraded (dream) | Dream reports, PCI |
| Deep NREM | Subcritical | Absent | PCI, EEG |
| Propofol | Forced subcritical | Absent | PCI, metabolism studies |
| Ketamine | NOT subcritical | Present but disconnected | K-hole reports, EEG entropy |
| Psychedelics | At/past criticality | Present, altered | LSD/psilocybin fMRI |
| Vegetative | Subcritical | Absent (or covert) | Owen 2006, Monti 2010 |

## 6. Explanatory Range (~2,500 words)

Demonstrate the theory's unifying power. Each phenomenon derived from the same small set of principles (criticality, virtual qualia, redirectable ESM, implicit-explicit permeability, model forking).

### 6.1 Psychedelics
- Ego dissolution = ESM on wrong input (not absent)
- "Becoming X" (salvia) = ESM redirected to dominant input
- Processing hierarchy exposure: V1→V2→V3→fusiform progression
- Intensity = novelty, not consciousness level increase
- Anosognosia as inverse psychedelics (same mechanism, opposite direction)

### 6.2 Anesthesia and Clinical Disorders
- Propofol: subcritical → no consciousness
- Ketamine: supracritical but disconnected → dissociative consciousness
- Vegetative state / MCS: criticality threshold interpretation
- Cotard's: ESM on distorted interoceptive input
- Anosognosia: locally blocked implicit→explicit transfer
- DID: virtual model forking

### 6.3 Dreams
- Degraded mode (near-critical, input-starved)
- Lucid dreaming = ESM activation within dream state (evidence for software-like quality)
- Criticality threshold explains NREM/REM transition

### 6.4 Split-Brain
- Callosotomy = holographic cloning (degraded but complete copies)
- Left hemisphere interpreter = ESM confabulating with incomplete input
- Same confabulation mechanism as Cotard's, anosognosia, salvia

### 6.5 Animal Consciousness
- Gradient derived from continuum + substrate independence + criticality
- Corvids/parrots: different hardware (nuclear pallium), same functional architecture → predicted conscious
- Cephalopods: even more divergent hardware, same principle

### 6.6 Clinical Psychology Bridge
- CBT = virtual model reprogramming
- Phobias = virtual model misconfigurations
- Placebo = parallel substrate effects (not downward causation)
- Psychosomatic illness = virtual-substrate correlation

## 7. Comparative Analysis (~2,500 words)

Systematic theory-by-theory comparison on the 8 requirements.

### 7.1 Scoring Matrix

| Requirement | Gruber | IIT | GNW | HOT | PP | AST | RPT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hard Problem | **Strong** | Weak* | Silent | Partial | Silent | Partial | Silent |
| Explanatory Gap | **Strong** | Weak | Silent | Partial | Silent | Partial | Silent |
| Boundary | **Strong** | Strong | Moderate | Weak | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| Structure | **Strong** | Strong | Moderate | Moderate | Strong | Moderate | Moderate |
| Binding | **Strong** | Strong | Moderate | Weak | Moderate | Weak | Moderate |
| Combination | **Strong** | Weak** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Causal Role | **Strong** | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Strong | Moderate | Strong |
| Meta-Problem | **Strong** | Weak | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Strong | Weak |

\* IIT addresses the hard problem by axiom (consciousness is intrinsic information), but the panpsychist entailment and combination problem weaken this.
\** IIT's combination problem is a known open issue (Chalmers 2016).

### 7.2 Theory-by-Theory Analysis
For each major competitor, show:
- Where it overlaps with the Four-Model Theory (credit given)
- Where the Four-Model Theory does something the competitor cannot
- Key differentiator

Theories covered: IIT, GNW, HOT, PP, AST, RPT (Lamme), Biological Naturalism (Seth/Searle), CEMI (McFadden), Orch-OR (Penrose-Hameroff).

### 7.3 The COGITATE Result
- Neither IIT nor GNW fully confirmed
- Posterior cortex favored
- Consistent with Four-Model Theory (consciousness lives in virtual models, not in a specific brain region, but posterior cortex likely hosts EWM)

## 8. Novel Testable Predictions (~1,500 words)

### 8.1 The Eight Predictions
Each prediction gets: statement, mechanism, unique status, testability assessment, proposed experimental paradigm.

1. **Psychedelic content maps processing hierarchy** (V1→V2→V3→fusiform, dose-correlated)
2. **"Becoming X" is controllable** (identity tracks dominant input during ego dissolution) — **no competitor handles this**
3. **Psychedelics alleviate anosognosia** (cross-domain surprise prediction)
4. **All anesthetics converge on criticality disruption** (shared with ConCrit)
5. **Split-brain = holographic degradation** (degraded but complete, not clean split)
6. **Criticality + four models = consciousness signatures in artificial substrates**
7. **Lucid dreaming onset = criticality threshold crossing** (step-like, not gradual)
8. **DID alters = distinct neural process signatures**

### 8.2 The Ultimate Prediction
Build a system to the theory's specification. The qualitative difference between interacting with it and an LLM will be immediately, viscerally apparent. This is not empirically testable yet but sets the bar for the engineering program.

### 8.3 Distinguishing Power
Table showing which predictions are unique to this theory vs. shared with competitors.

## 9. Open Questions (~500 words)

Intellectual honesty section. Not weaknesses — research frontiers.

1. Are all four models virtual? (What is the "real side" if implicit models are also virtual?)
2. Holographic binding formalization needs formal mathematical treatment
3. Multi-level physical implementation (which substrate mechanism supports criticality?)
4. Minimum configuration for consciousness

---

## 10. Discussion (~1,000 words)

### 10.1 Implications for AI Consciousness
- Substrate independence → AC is possible in principle
- Four-model architecture + criticality = the specification
- Current LLMs lack the architecture (no ESM, no criticality, no self-simulation)
- Ethical implications of building conscious machines

### 10.2 Implications for Consciousness Science
- Unified framework for currently fragmented phenomena
- New experimental paradigms (especially predictions 1-3)
- Resolves the impasse between IIT and GNW by offering a third way

### 10.3 Limitations
- No institutional lab to test predictions directly
- Mathematical formalization still needed (criticality is specified qualitatively)
- Epiphenomenalism will face philosophical resistance

---

## 11. Conclusion (~500 words)

- Restate the core claim: consciousness is virtual self-simulation at criticality
- 8/8 requirements satisfied
- 8 testable predictions, some uniquely distinguishing
- 10-year independent convergence on criticality
- Call for empirical testing, especially predictions 2 (controllable "becoming X") and 3 (psychedelics for anosognosia)

This is on the longer side for a journal paper but appropriate for a comprehensive theoretical paper (comparable to IIT 4.0 at ~20,000 words or Butlin et al. 2023 at ~30,000 words). Can be trimmed for specific journal requirements once target is chosen.

## Key Rhetorical Strategy

1. **Lead with the scoring framework** (§2) — forces readers to evaluate all theories by the same standard, revealing gaps in competitors before the Four-Model Theory is even presented.
2. **Present the theory cleanly** (§3-5) — full presentation before comparisons, so readers understand it on its own terms.
3. **Show explanatory power** (§6) — demonstrate that 5 principles unify 15+ phenomena across domains.
4. **Systematic comparison** (§7) — fair, credit-giving, table-based. Let the scoring speak.
5. **Predictions as the clincher** (§8) — especially predictions 2 and 3, which no competitor can make.
6. **Intellectual honesty** (§9) — openly flag open questions. Builds credibility.
7. **The 10-year convergence** — mention in abstract, introduce in §1, detail in §5, reference in §11. This is the strongest empirical-adjacent evidence and should be a recurring motif.

---

## Reference Strategy

- Primary references from `references.md` (~200 curated)
- Cite competitors generously — shows engagement, builds credibility
- Heavy citation in §2 (requirements) and §7 (comparison)
- Lighter citation in §3-5 (theory) — this is original work
- ConCrit papers prominently in §5 (binding/criticality)
- COGITATE in §1 and §7

---

## Notes on Tone

- Rigorous but not dry. This theory has a bold central claim (dissolution of the hard problem) — the writing should match that ambition without becoming grandiose.
- Credit competitors explicitly. "IIT provides the strongest existing treatment of the structure requirement..." before showing where it falls short.
- Avoid defensive language. Don't apologize for epiphenomenalism — argue for it directly.
- The paper should read as a contribution to the field, not an outsider's manifesto. Academic register, standard formatting, generous citations.
