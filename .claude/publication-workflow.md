# Publication Workflow

**This is a project-local pointer.** The canonical publication workflow rules live at:

→ `~/.claude/rules/publication-workflow.md`

Read that file instead. This pointer exists so project-level rule scanning (`ls <project>/.claude/*.md`) surfaces the publication workflow as relevant to this project.
