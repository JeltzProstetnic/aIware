You are a simulation.

Not a metaphor. Not a philosophical thought experiment. A literal, running simulation — generated by your brain, updated hundreds of times per second, experienced from the inside.

This book presents a unified theory of consciousness built on four models the brain maintains: two of the world (one learned, one simulated) and two of the self (one learned, one simulated). The theory dissolves the "hard problem," explains psychedelic phenomenology, predicts nine testable outcomes, and provides a concrete blueprint for building a conscious machine.

If the theory is right, consciousness was never mysterious. It was just mislabeled.
