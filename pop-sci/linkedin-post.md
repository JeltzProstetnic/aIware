In 2015, I published a theory of consciousness. A 300-page book in German. It sold zero copies.

Ten years later, one of its core predictions — that consciousness requires the brain to operate at the edge of chaos — was independently confirmed by a large-scale empirical study synthesizing 140 datasets.

I never knew about that research program while writing. They never knew about my book. Two completely independent paths, converging on the same conclusion a decade apart.

That was the moment I decided to stop waiting for the world to find the book and start bringing the theory to the world.

Today I'm making the scientific paper publicly available. It's called "The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness" — an ~18,000 word paper that:

- Dissolves the hard problem of consciousness (without panpsychism, without hand-waving)
- Addresses all eight major requirements for a complete theory of consciousness
- Explains psychedelics, anesthesia, dreams, split-brain, and animal consciousness from five principles
- Makes nine novel testable predictions, including two that no competing theory can generate
- Provides a concrete specification for what a conscious machine would look like

The theory's central claim: consciousness is a real-time self-simulation. Qualia exist within the simulation, not at the physical level. The "hard problem" rests on a category error.

The paper was stress-tested through 10 adversarial challenges before writing. It's rigorous, honest about its limitations, and open about its commitments (yes, epiphenomenalism — and I defend it).

Next steps: journal submission (targeting Frontiers), followed by a pop-science article and eventually the engineering challenge of building what the theory describes.

The paper, all supporting materials, and the complete record of the adversarial challenge process are available here:

If you work in consciousness science, neuroscience, philosophy of mind, or AI — I'd welcome your scrutiny. The theory makes real predictions, and real predictions can fail. That's what makes it science.

- Keep the link as the only link (LinkedIn deprioritizes posts with multiple links)
- Consider posting between Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am for max visibility
- If there's a relevant image (the four-model architecture diagram), attach it — posts with images get 2x engagement
- First comment: tag any researchers or contacts in the consciousness field
