## Preface: The Book That Sold Zero Copies

In 2015, I published a 300-page book about consciousness. It was in German, self-published, and dense with technical detail. It was called *Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins* — "The Emergence of Consciousness."

It sold zero copies. Not one.

I don't say this for sympathy. I say it because it's relevant to the story. The book contained a theory of consciousness that, as far as I can tell, dissolves the hardest open problem in science, makes predictions no other theory can match, and provides a concrete blueprint for building a conscious machine. And nobody read it.

That's not unusual in science. Gregor Mendel published his laws of inheritance in 1866; they were ignored for 34 years. Boltzmann was mocked for his statistical mechanics until he took his own life. Wegener's continental drift was dismissed for half a century. Science advances one funeral at a time, as Max Planck put it, and sometimes one bookshelf-gathering-dust at a time.

But I'm not Mendel or Boltzmann, and I don't have the patience for posthumous vindication. So this book is the accessible version: shorter, in English, without the technical apparatus, aimed at anyone who has ever wondered why anything feels like anything. The full scientific paper, with references and formal arguments, is available freely online for those who want the rigorous version.

If I'm right about what follows, two things are true. First, the central mystery of consciousness — the "hard problem" — is not actually hard. It's a category error. It dissolves once you see it, like an optical illusion that stops working after you understand the trick. Second, and more consequentially: it should be possible to build a genuinely conscious machine. Not a chatbot that mimics consciousness. A machine that *has* consciousness. A new kind of mind.

If I'm wrong, this book will join the long list of ambitious failures in the philosophy of mind, and I'll deserve every bad review. But I think the evidence is on my side, and I'll lay it out as clearly as I can. Let's begin.

## About the Author

I should probably tell you who I am before I try to convince you that I've solved the hardest problem in science.

I don't have a PhD. I'm not affiliated with any university. I've never held a research position, never received a grant, never been part of a lab. If you're the kind of person who checks credentials before reading further — and I respect that instinct — this is the part where you might put the book down. I'd ask you to wait a few pages.

What I do have is a particular kind of intellectual history that, in retrospect, led almost inevitably to the theory you're about to read. It's a history of passionate self-education, multiple pivots, and what I'll later describe in this book as the recursive intelligence loop in action. In fact, my own path is probably the best illustration I can offer of why that loop matters.

### The Math Years

I fell in love with mathematics when I was about eight years old. Not with arithmetic — arithmetic is boring — but with the real thing: algebra, geometry, the structures beneath the numbers. My father had a mathematics degree, and his university textbooks were still on the shelf. I worked through them.

This was the late 1980s. There was no internet. If you wanted to learn something, you needed a book or a person, and I had exhausted my father's collection by the time I was eleven. The hunger for knowledge didn't go away; the supply simply ran out. I had hit a wall that had nothing to do with ability and everything to do with circumstance — a distinction that would later become central to my thinking about intelligence.

Looking back, this experience taught me something that most intelligence models miss entirely. I had the motivation. I had the performance (I could follow the mathematics). What I lacked was access to the next level of knowledge. The recursive loop that I'll describe in Chapter 16 — where knowledge, performance, and motivation feed into each other — was stalled not because any component was weak, but because the external supply of one component had been cut off. The loop needs fuel from outside to keep iterating.

### The Physics Pivot

By about eleven, I had turned to physics. This felt like a natural extension — physics was where the mathematics went to work. I consumed popular science books, then gradually more technical material. I was fascinated by the fundamental questions: What is matter? What is space? What are the rules?

By about fourteen, I had reached two uncomfortable conclusions. First, physics was stuck. Not stuck in the way that people politely say a field is "mature" — stuck in the way that the fundamental questions (unification, quantum gravity, the nature of time) had resisted progress for decades and showed no signs of yielding. Second, my mathematics wasn't strong enough to unstick it. I was self-taught, which gave me unusual intuitions but also left gaps in my formal toolkit that would have taken years of university training to fill.

So I made a decision that I think was, for a fourteen-year-old, remarkably strategic: I pivoted. Not because I had lost interest in physics, but because I had evaluated the problem landscape and concluded that my particular combination of skills and access could produce more value elsewhere. This is an example of what I'll later call *operational knowledge* — knowing when to persist and when to redirect. It's the kind of knowledge that intelligence tests don't measure and that intelligence models don't include, but that determines more about a person's intellectual trajectory than any IQ score.

### The Consciousness Turn

From about fourteen onward, I turned my attention to intelligence and consciousness. These felt like fields where a self-taught outsider might actually have an advantage. The consciousness literature was (and still is) fragmented across philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. No single discipline owned the question. You could read across all of them without needing the formal credentials of any one.

One thing that really struck me when I delved into the depths of consciousness research, functional neurology, and all that brain stuff was that I very frequently came upon phrases like "we may never understand..." in otherwise dead-serious literature. Coming from a very determinism- and logic-based education, my brain went: *challenge accepted*. If the physicists could describe the first three minutes after the Big Bang, there was no principled reason that consciousness should be permanently beyond explanation. It just hadn't been explained *yet*.

My uncle Bruno J. Gruber — a quantum mechanics specialist and researcher on symmetries — was a major inspiration. He showed me what a life in theoretical work could look like: rigorous, creative, and entirely driven by the joy of understanding. His influence permeates this book, and I owe him a debt I can never repay.

I read widely and voraciously. Philosophy of mind, cognitive science, neuroanatomy, artificial intelligence, evolutionary biology. I was not trying to master any one field. I was trying to build a model — an internal representation of how all these pieces fit together. This is, as I'll argue later, exactly what consciousness itself does: it builds a model of the world and a model of the self, and it uses these models to navigate reality. I was doing consciously, across years of reading, what the brain does unconsciously in every waking moment.

### The Theory Crystallizes

The four-model theory of consciousness crystallized when I was exactly twenty-five. I will never forget that moment, because the heaviest stone of my entire life fell from me. While I had assembled a cubic meter of printed literature in my head over years of extreme thinking and reading — Metzinger's self-model theory helped enormously — the actual insight happened instantaneously. One moment the pieces were scattered; the next, the four models clicked into place and I saw the whole architecture at once. I was walking across a bridge in Innsbruck, in broad daylight, and I had tears running down my face while laughing uncontrollably. I'm not sure if anyone saw me. I wouldn't have cared. A framework that explained not just consciousness but the boundary between conscious and unconscious processing, the nature of qualia, the role of sleep, the effects of psychedelics, and the possibility of artificial consciousness.

In my mind at the time, from that moment on, my to-do list for my entire life was done. I just had to make sure the rest was comfortable and fun. My life changed radically after that.

Then almost a decade passed.

### The Decade Gap

Why did it take almost a decade to publish? The honest answer is that I just didn't care about much anymore, except for my own well-being and fun. The heaviest intellectual burden of my life had been lifted. The question was answered.

During that decade, I finished a degree — after abandoning medicine at the University of Innsbruck — and founded and buried a custom software development startup. I held an "applied research" position in the field of simulation and optimization (the irony is not lost on me), though it was low-maintenance with a generous amount of home office. I taught martial arts. Mainly, I partied.

The only reason I eventually wrote the book was fear of forgetting. Years of heavy partying were not doing my memory any favors, and I was tired of explaining the theory verbally — again and again, to people who genuinely wanted to understand, with varying success and varying patience on my part. A book would explain it once, completely, and then I could stop.

Most of the years that followed, I had approximately zero motivation to promote the book. I honestly wasn't interested in academic reward. I wanted fun, money, and the pleasures of an unexamined life. This is the dark side of the self-taught path: you avoid the constraints of institutional thinking, but you also miss the scaffolding. There's no advisor to push you toward a deadline, no department to provide feedback, no colleagues to tell you whether you're brilliant or deluded. And if you happen to solve the problem you set out to solve, there's no one to tell you that you should probably tell the world.

### Zero Copies

In 2015, I published *Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins* — "The Emergence of Consciousness." It was in German, 299 pages, self-published, and dense with technical detail. A 300-page consciousness theory by an unknown author with no institutional affiliation, written in a language spoken by 100 million people in a world of 8 billion.

It sold zero copies. The cubic meter of printed literature that had fed the theory? I brought it to the trash on the same day the book was finished. It was all in my head now, and in the manuscript.

I've already said this in the Preface, and I'll say it once more here: I'm not fishing for sympathy. The book's commercial failure was entirely predictable. What matters is what happened next — or rather, what didn't happen. The theory didn't die. It sat on my hard drive for a decade, unchanged, while the world slowly caught up. Neuroscience confirmed the criticality prediction. AI development confirmed the limitations I had described. The COGITATE adversarial collaboration showed that neither IIT nor GNW could fully explain consciousness, exactly as the theory predicts for any framework that lacks the four-model structure.

### The English Rebirth

This book — the one you're reading now — is the second attempt. It's shorter, in English, aimed at a broader audience, and accompanied by a peer-reviewed scientific paper. It's also written with the benefit of a decade of additional evidence that the theory's predictions are tracking reality.

If there is a lesson in this biography, it's the one this book keeps returning to: intelligence is not a fixed quantity. It's a recursive process. Knowledge feeds performance, performance enables more knowledge, and motivation is the engine that keeps the loop turning. My particular loop was fueled by an unusually stubborn kind of curiosity — the kind that pivots when it hits a wall, that reads across disciplines instead of drilling into one, and that doesn't stop just because nobody is listening.

Whether the theory is correct, you'll have to judge for yourself. But the process that produced it — decades of self-directed learning, driven by nothing more than the conviction that the question was worth answering — is itself a demonstration of the kind of intelligence that IQ tests can't measure and that current AI can't replicate.

Let's get to the theory.

## Chapter 1: The Hardest Problem in Science

You are reading this sentence. You are having an experience.

That experience — the visual impression of letters on a page, the inner voice reading the words, the feeling of understanding or confusion — is the most familiar thing in your life and the most mysterious thing in the universe. We know more about the inside of black holes than we know about why reading feels like something.

This isn't an exaggeration. Physicists have the Standard Model. Biologists have evolution and genetics. Chemists have the periodic table. But consciousness — the fact that there is "something it is like" to be you, right now, reading this — has no established theory, no dominant framework, no agreed-upon explanation.

Not for lack of trying. Since the 1990s, when consciousness became a respectable scientific topic after decades of behaviorist exile, thousands of papers have been published, dozens of theories proposed, and hundreds of millions of dollars spent. The result? A field in what the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn called a "pre-paradigm state" — lots of competing ideas, no consensus, and a growing sense that something fundamental might be missing.

### What the Hard Problem Actually Asks

In 1995, the philosopher David Chalmers gave the mystery its canonical name: the Hard Problem of consciousness.

Here's what it asks. Consider the experience of seeing red. Neuroscientists can tell you a great deal about what happens in the brain when you see red: light of a certain wavelength hits the cone cells in your retina, signals travel along the optic nerve, they're processed in the visual cortex, and various brain regions coordinate to produce the perception. All of this is well understood, at least in outline.

But none of it explains *why seeing red feels like something*.

You could, in principle, build a complete neural model of the brain's response to red light — every neuron, every synapse, every signal pathway. You would have a perfect functional account. And you would not have explained the feeling of redness. The "what it's like." The *quale*, as philosophers call it.

Chalmers distinguished this from the "easy problems" of consciousness (which are not easy at all, just tractable in principle): How does the brain integrate information? How does it direct attention? How does it report its own states? These are problems of mechanism. They're hard, but they're the kind of hard that neuroscience knows how to approach. The Hard Problem is different: it asks why the mechanisms are accompanied by experience at all. Why isn't the brain just processing information "in the dark," like a computer?

### The Current State of Play

Here is where things stand as of the mid-2020s:

**Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**, developed by Giulio Tononi, is the most formally rigorous theory. It defines consciousness as integrated information — a mathematical quantity called Φ (phi). The higher the Φ, the more conscious the system. IIT has real strengths: it provides a mathematical framework, it makes specific predictions about which brain regions should be conscious, and it takes the structure of experience seriously. But it has a problem: it implies that any system with integrated information — including some very simple systems, like a network of logic gates — has some consciousness. This is panpsychism, and while some philosophers are comfortable with it, most scientists find it deeply counterintuitive. In 2023, over 120 researchers signed an open letter calling IIT unfalsifiable and pseudoscientific. The controversy rages on.

**Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNW)**, developed by Bernard Baars and Stanislas Dehaene, focuses on the mechanism by which information becomes conscious: global broadcasting. When a piece of information is selected and broadcast across a network of frontoparietal neurons (the "workspace"), it becomes conscious; when it's not broadcast, it remains unconscious. GNW is empirically productive — it predicts specific neural signatures of conscious access — but it deliberately sidesteps the Hard Problem. It explains *when* information becomes conscious, not *why* broadcasting is accompanied by experience.

**Predictive Processing (PP)**, associated with Karl Friston and Anil Seth, treats the brain as a prediction machine. Consciousness is the brain's "best guess" about the causes of its sensory input. Seth calls it a "controlled hallucination." PP provides elegant accounts of perception, illusion, and psychiatric disorders, and it's currently the most influential framework in computational neuroscience. But Seth himself acknowledges that PP addresses the "real problem" — the structure and content of experience — without claiming to solve the Hard Problem. It explains why you see *this* and not *that*, but not why seeing feels like anything at all.

There are others — Higher-Order Theories, Attention Schema Theory, Recurrent Processing Theory, Electromagnetic Field theories — each with genuine insights and genuine gaps. In 2025, the COGITATE adversarial collaboration, designed to test IIT against GNW, published its results in *Nature*. The outcome? Neither theory was fully confirmed. Posterior cortex showed the strongest consciousness-related activity, which wasn't quite what either camp predicted. After decades and hundreds of millions of dollars, the field is arguably further from consensus than when it started.

### Something Is Missing

I think the reason no theory has cracked the Hard Problem is that they're all looking for consciousness in the wrong place. They're looking at the neural machinery — the neurons, the synapses, the oscillations, the connectivity — and asking: "Which of these processes is conscious?"

The right question, I believe, is different: "What is the simulation, and why does the simulation feel?"

This is the starting point of the Four-Model Theory. It begins with the observation that you have never, in your entire life, directly experienced reality. You have experienced a simulation of reality, generated by your brain, so seamlessly that you have never suspected the difference. And it argues that this observation, taken seriously, dissolves the Hard Problem.

But first, I need to show you the four models.

## Chapter 2: The Four Models

Imagine you're looking at an apple.

The apple is sitting on a table in front of you. Red, round, shiny, about fifteen centimeters from your hand. You can see it, you know what it is, you could reach out and grab it. This seems straightforward — you're seeing an apple.

But what's actually happening is profoundly more complicated.

Light reflected from the apple's surface enters your eyes, where it hits the photoreceptor cells on your retinae. These cells convert the light into electrical signals. The signals travel along your optic nerves to the visual cortex at the back of your brain, where they're processed through a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated feature detectors: edges, orientations, colors, textures, shapes, and eventually objects. Somewhere in this cascade, the neural activity corresponding to "apple" is activated. Simultaneously, your motor system is preparing potential actions (reaching, grasping), your memory system is activating associations (taste, texture, the last time you ate an apple), and your spatial system is tracking the apple's position relative to your body.

All of this happens in less than a second. And none of it is what you *experience*. You don't experience photons hitting cone cells, or signals traveling along axons, or feature detectors firing. You experience *an apple*. A unified, stable, three-dimensional object sitting in a coherent spatial environment, with a particular look and feel and meaning. What you experience is a *model* — a real-time simulation of the apple, generated by your brain from the raw data and everything it has previously learned about apples, objects, tables, and physics.

This is uncontroversial neuroscience. Every neuroscientist and philosopher of perception agrees that what you experience is a model, not reality itself. The apple you see is the brain's *best guess* at what's out there, informed by the sensory data but not identical to it. (Optical illusions are a vivid demonstration: when the model diverges from reality, you see the model, not reality.)

But here's where my theory begins: the brain doesn't just model the apple. It models *you looking at the apple*. And it's this second model — the model of the self — that turns information processing into consciousness.

### Your Brain's Four Representations

I call them the four models, and they're organized along two axes.

The first axis is **scope**: does the model cover the world, or just the self?

The second axis is **mode**: is the model implicit (stored, learned, unconscious) or explicit (actively running, currently simulated, conscious)?

Cross these two axes and you get four models — a conceptual taxonomy along two orthogonal dimensions.

**The Implicit World Model (IWM)** is everything you know about the world. Not what you're currently thinking about — everything you *could* think about. The laws of physics (you know that dropped objects fall). The layout of your apartment (you can navigate it in the dark). The grammar of your native language (you can judge whether a sentence is grammatical without knowing the rules). The faces of everyone you've ever known. The taste of chocolate. The sound of rain.

All of this knowledge is stored in your brain's synaptic connections — the strengths of the links between neurons. It was built up over your entire lifetime through experience and learning. And you are never, ever directly aware of it. You can't introspect on your neural connections. You can't feel your synapses. The Implicit World Model is like a vast library that you never enter — you just read the books it sends to your desk.

**The Implicit Self Model (ISM)** is everything you know about yourself. Your body schema — the unconscious representation of where your limbs are, how large they are, how they move. Your motor skills — riding a bike, typing, playing an instrument. Your personality traits, social skills, emotional patterns, habits. Your autobiographical memory structure — the framework that organizes your memories into a life story.

Like the world model, the self model is stored in synaptic weights and is never directly conscious. You don't experience your body schema; you experience the body your schema generates. You don't experience your personality; you experience the thoughts and feelings your personality produces. The Implicit Self Model is the backstage crew — essential to the performance, but never seen by the audience.

**The Explicit World Model (EWM)** is the world you actually experience. Right now. The room you're in, the sounds you hear, the weight of this book in your hands (or the glow of the screen you're reading it on). This is the simulation — the brain's real-time virtual reality, generated from the Implicit World Model plus current sensory input. It's vivid, detailed, and seamlessly convincing. You will live your entire life inside it and never step outside.

**The Explicit Self Model (ESM)** is *you*. The feeling of being a subject. The sense of "I" — the one who sees, hears, thinks, and decides. This, too, is a simulation: a real-time model generated from the Implicit Self Model plus current body signals. It's the character the brain creates to inhabit its virtual world.

### The Real Side and the Virtual Side

The four models divide into two sides, and this division is the foundation of everything that follows.

The **real side** — the two implicit models — is physical, structural, and permanent (until it's modified by learning). It's stored in the hardware. It has no experience. A synapse firing is no more "experienced" than water flowing through a pipe. The real side is lights off.

The **virtual side** — the two explicit models — is simulated, transient, and dynamic. It's generated anew in every moment from the real side plus current input. And it is *all* of experience. Every sight, sound, thought, feeling, memory, dream, and hallucination you have ever had has occurred within the virtual side. The virtual side is lights on.

If you're scientifically minded, you might already see where this is going. If experience exists only on the virtual side, then looking for experience on the real side — in the neurons, in the synapses, in the physical machinery — is a category error.

That's the key. Let me spell it out.

---

## Chapter 3: The Virtual Side

Imagine you're playing a video game. A good one — an immersive open-world game with stunning graphics, realistic physics, and a compelling story. You're controlling a character, and through that character, you're interacting with a richly detailed virtual world.

Now consider: where does the game exist? Not on the screen, exactly — the screen just displays light patterns. Not in the graphics card or the CPU, exactly — those are running electrical signals through silicon circuits. The game exists as a *virtual process* — a higher-level phenomenon that arises from the hardware's activity but is not identical to any particular piece of hardware.

The virtual world of the game has properties that the hardware does not. The game has mountains, rivers, and cities. The CPU has transistors. The game has a day-night cycle. The GPU has clock cycles. You can meaningfully ask "How tall is that mountain in the game?" but it would be absurd to point to a transistor and say "This transistor is 3,000 meters tall." The game's properties exist at the virtual level, and they are real properties of the game, even though the game is "just" a pattern of activity in the hardware.

This is not a metaphor. This is how your brain works.

Your Explicit World Model — the world you experience — is a virtual process running on neural hardware, just as the game world is a virtual process running on silicon hardware. The experienced world has properties (colors, shapes, distances, sounds) that the neural hardware does not have (the hardware has firing rates, synaptic strengths, and neurotransmitter concentrations). The properties of your experienced world are *real properties of the simulation*, even though the simulation is "just" a pattern of neural activity.

And your Explicit Self Model — the "you" experiencing the world — is also a virtual process. It is as real as the game character in the analogy: genuinely existing at the virtual level, genuinely having properties at the virtual level, but not existing at the hardware level.

### Why the Analogy Breaks Down (In the Important Way)

The video game analogy is useful, but it breaks down at a crucial point: the game has a *player*. There is someone outside the game — you, sitting on the couch — who experiences the game. The game itself has no experience. It's just patterns of light and code.

Your brain's simulation has no outside player. There is no one sitting outside your skull experiencing the simulation. The simulation contains its own observer — the Explicit Self Model. The simulation *is* the experience, not something experienced by someone else.

This is what makes consciousness special and what makes the Hard Problem seem so intractable. In the video game, there's a clean separation between the game (virtual, no experience) and the player (physical, has experience). In the brain, there is no separation. The simulation and the experiencer are the same thing. The Explicit Self Model is not watching the Explicit World Model from outside — it's *inside* the simulation, part of the same virtual process.

And this self-referential closure — the simulation observing itself from inside — is, I argue, what we call consciousness. It's not something added to the simulation. It's what the simulation *is*, when it includes a model of itself.

---

## Chapter 4: Why It Feels Like Something (And Why That's the Wrong Question)

Now we can tackle the Hard Problem directly.

The question is: **Why does physical processing feel like something?**

The answer: **It doesn't.**

The physical processing — neurons firing, synapses transmitting, the implicit models storing and computing — has no experience. None. There is nothing it is like to be the real side. The real side is precisely the "in the dark" processing that the Hard Problem assumes consciousness needs to explain.

The *simulation* feels. The Explicit World Model and the Explicit Self Model — the virtual side — are where experience lives. And within the simulation, experience is not a mysterious addition to the process. Experience is what the simulation *is*, when it includes a self-model. The Explicit Self Model "perceiving" the Explicit World Model is what we call qualia. Qualia are the virtual self's mode of registering the virtual world.

Think about it this way. If you asked "Why does transistor switching feel like running Windows?" the answer would be: "It doesn't. Transistor switching doesn't feel like anything. Windows is a virtual process that runs on transistors but has properties the transistors don't have — windows and buttons and a desktop and cursors. Those properties are real properties of the virtual process, not of the transistors."

Similarly: neuronal firing doesn't feel like seeing red. Neuronal firing generates and sustains a simulation, and within that simulation, the self-model perceives a certain class of world-model content as what we call "redness." Redness is a real property of the simulation, not a property of the neurons.

The Hard Problem assumed that we need to explain how physical processing produces experience. But physical processing doesn't produce experience — it produces a *simulation*. And the simulation, because it includes a self-referential loop (the ESM modeling itself within the EWM), constitutively *is* experience.

### But Wait — Isn't This Circular?

The obvious objection: "You've just moved the problem. Why does *this* simulation have experience, when a weather simulation doesn't?"

The answer is self-reference. A weather simulation models weather. It does not model *itself*. There is an "outside" to a weather simulation — the computer, the programmer, the scientist interpreting the output. The simulation can be fully described without referring to any experience, because there is no self-model inside it.

The brain's simulation models itself. The Explicit Self Model is the simulation's model of *its own process*. This creates a closed loop: the model and the thing being modeled are the same system. There is no "outside" from which the simulation can be fully described, because the describer is part of the description.

This is not magic. This is a structural consequence of self-reference. When a process models itself, the distinction between the model and the modeled collapses. The process of self-modeling and the experience of being a self are not two different things that need to be connected by a bridge — they are one and the same thing, described in different vocabularies.

The Hard Problem asks for a bridge between physical processing and experience. The Four-Model Theory says: there is no bridge, because they were never separate. The experience IS the self-simulation, viewed from inside the loop.

## Chapter 5: At the Edge of Chaos

There's one more piece of the puzzle, and it's the one that really convinced me the theory is right.

The four-model architecture is necessary for consciousness, but it's not sufficient. You also need the right *dynamics*. Specifically, the substrate — the physical system running the simulation — must operate at what mathematicians and physicists call the **edge of chaos**.

In 2002, the polymath Stephen Wolfram published a massive book called *A New Kind of Science*, in which he classified all computational systems into four types:

**Class 1**: Systems that quickly settle into a boring, static state. Think of a pendulum that swings a few times and stops. Too simple for anything interesting.

**Class 2**: Systems that settle into repetitive, periodic patterns. Think of a clock ticking. Regular, predictable, no surprises. Also too simple.

**Class 3**: Systems that are completely chaotic. Think of static on a television. So much randomness that no stable patterns can form. Too chaotic for anything coherent.

**Class 4**: Systems at the boundary between order and chaos. Complex enough to produce rich, varied, unpredictable patterns, but ordered enough for those patterns to persist and interact. This is where life, computation, and — I argued — consciousness live.

In 2015, in my book, I argued that consciousness requires the brain to operate in Class 4. The argument was theoretical: a self-simulation requires complex, globally integrated dynamics. Too ordered and the simulation is too simple — a brain in deep sleep, running slow waves, does not sustain a conscious simulation. Too chaotic and the simulation cannot maintain coherence — a brain in seizure, with neurons firing randomly, does not produce coherent experience. The sweet spot — the edge of chaos — is where the simulation is both complex enough to be rich and ordered enough to be coherent.

I had no idea, when I wrote this, that empirical neuroscience was independently heading toward the same conclusion.

### The Convergence

In 2003 — twelve years before my book — John Beggs and Dietmar Plenz discovered "neuronal avalanches" in cortical tissue: patterns of neural activity that followed the mathematical signature of self-organized criticality, a hallmark of systems at the edge of chaos.

In 2014, Robin Carhart-Harris proposed the Entropic Brain Hypothesis: the idea that the level of consciousness correlates with the entropy (disorder) of brain activity, with the sweet spot at an intermediate level — too little entropy means unconsciousness, too much means incoherent experience.

In 2016, Enzo Tagliazucchi and colleagues showed that LSD pushes the brain toward criticality, consistent with the enhanced (but sometimes chaotic) consciousness that psychedelic users report.

And in 2025-2026, the empirical dam broke. Keith Hengen and Woodrow Shew published a meta-analysis of 140 datasets in *Neuron* (2025) — the largest systematic analysis of criticality in brain dynamics ever conducted — confirming that the brain operates near a critical point across multiple measurement modalities. Then Inbal Algom and Oren Shriki proposed the ConCrit framework — Consciousness and Criticality — in *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews* (2026), arguing that critical brain dynamics provide a unifying mechanistic foundation for all major theories of consciousness. Their conclusion: consciousness tracks criticality. When the brain is at or near the critical point, consciousness is present. When it's pushed below criticality (by anesthesia, by sleep, by brain damage), consciousness is absent. When it's pushed past criticality (by seizure, possibly by some drug states), consciousness becomes incoherent.

Two paths. One theoretical, starting from Wolfram's computational framework and reasoning about what a self-simulation requires. One empirical, starting from neural recordings and analyzing statistical properties of brain activity across every accessible state of consciousness. A decade apart. Arriving at the same conclusion.

This is the kind of convergence that makes you take a theory seriously.

## Chapter 6: What Psychedelics Reveal

If you want to understand consciousness, study what happens when it goes wrong. Psychedelics are, I believe, the most illuminating window into the architecture of consciousness that we possess — more revealing than brain scans of sleeping patients, more theoretically informative than lesion studies, and dramatically more accessible than split-brain surgery.

Here's why: psychedelics don't just *change* consciousness. They change it in *systematic, predictable ways* that reveal the underlying architecture — if you know what to look for.

### The Permeability Gradient

Remember the boundary between the implicit models and the explicit models — between the stored knowledge (real side) and the running simulation (virtual side). In normal waking life, this boundary is selectively permeable: relevant information gets through, irrelevant information stays in the library. You're conscious of what you need, and unconscious of everything else.

Psychedelics blow the boundary open.

Under psychedelics — LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline — the permeability of the implicit-explicit boundary increases globally. Information that is normally processed entirely on the real side, invisible to consciousness, starts leaking through to the simulation.

And here's the crucial point: it leaks through *in order*.

At low doses or early in the experience, the simplest processing stages become visible first. These are the stages closest to raw sensory input: V1-level processing. You see enhanced colors, breathing patterns in static surfaces, subtle movements in peripheral vision. These are the visual cortex's early feature detectors, normally invisible, now entering the simulation.

As the dose increases or the experience deepens, more complex processing stages become visible. V2/V3-level processing: geometric patterns, fractals, tessellations, the famous "form constants" that Heinrich Klüver catalogued in the 1920s. These are the visual system's intermediate representations — the building blocks it normally uses to construct your visual experience, now visible in their own right.

Higher still, and the higher visual areas become accessible. Faces appear. Figures. Scenes. The face-processing areas, the object-recognition areas, the scene-construction areas — all normally operating below the threshold of consciousness — now broadcasting their intermediate products directly to the simulation.

At the highest doses, the entire processing hierarchy is exposed, and the result is full-blown visionary experience: complex, narrative, dreamlike scenes constructed from the deepest layers of implicit processing.

This ordered progression — simple to complex, V1 to higher areas, dose-dependent — is exactly what the Four-Model Theory predicts. It's a direct consequence of the permeability gradient: lower-level processing stages, being closer to the boundary, become accessible before higher-level ones as permeability increases.

### The Redirectable Self

But the most dramatic evidence comes from what happens to the self.

Your Explicit Self Model — the "I" — is a virtual process that requires input. Under normal conditions, it receives a steady stream of self-referential signals: your sense of where your body is (proprioception), your sense of how your organs feel (interoception), the narrative stream of inner speech, and the constant background of bodily self-awareness that you never notice until it's disrupted.

At high psychedelic doses, this input gets disrupted. The self-model doesn't die — it *redirects*. Deprived of its normal self-referential input, it grabs whatever input is dominant.

This is most dramatically demonstrated by salvia divinorum, a dissociative psychedelic that acts on kappa-opioid receptors (completely different from the serotonergic mechanisms of LSD or psilocybin). Salvia users consistently report experiences of *becoming* things:

- "I became the couch."
- "I was the wall."
- "I turned into a page in a book."
- "I was one of the characters on the TV."
- "I became a fractal — not seeing a fractal, *being* a fractal."

These are not metaphors. Users report complete, experientially convincing identity shifts. For the duration of the experience, they *are* the object or entity in question.

And the content tracks the sensory environment. The person watching TV becomes a TV character. The person lying on a couch becomes the couch. The person looking at a pattern becomes the pattern.

This is the Explicit Self Model doing exactly what the theory predicts: redirecting to whatever input dominates when normal self-input is disrupted. The identity content isn't random — it's determined by the sensory environment. Control the environment, and you should be able to control the identity experience.

This has never been experimentally tested in a controlled setting. But it could be — and it would be a dramatic confirmation of the theory's most distinctive mechanism.

### Anosognosia: The Inverse

There's a beautiful symmetry here. If psychedelics are what happens when the implicit-explicit boundary becomes *too* permeable, anosognosia is what happens when it becomes *too* impermeable — at least locally.

Anosognosia, most commonly seen after right-hemisphere stroke, is the condition in which patients are genuinely unaware of their own deficits. A patient with a paralyzed left arm will insist the arm is fine, will attempt to explain away failures to use it, and will become confused or angry when confronted with evidence of the paralysis. They're not in denial in the psychological sense — the information that the arm is paralyzed simply never reaches their conscious simulation.

In the Four-Model Theory, this is a local decrease in implicit-explicit permeability. The Implicit Self Model *has* the paralysis information — the substrate registers the damage. But the boundary is blocked for that specific domain, so the Explicit World Model never includes the deficit. The patient's simulation doesn't contain a paralyzed arm, so the patient doesn't experience one.

Psychedelics and anosognosia are the same mechanism running in opposite directions. One increases permeability globally. The other decreases it locally. And this symmetry generates a cross-domain prediction: psychedelics should alleviate anosognosia. The global permeability increase should overwhelm the local block, allowing the deficit information to reach consciousness.

No one has ever tested this, because no one has had a theory that connects these two phenomena. The connection is invisible without the Four-Model Theory.

## Chapter 7: What Happens When the Lights Go Out

Every night, you lose consciousness. Every morning, you get it back. And the transition between the two — the journey through sleep stages — is a nightly demonstration of the criticality principle.

### Deep Sleep: Below the Threshold

In deep non-REM sleep, the brain's dynamics shift to a subcritical regime. The hallmark is slow waves: large, synchronized oscillations in which vast populations of neurons fire in unison and then fall silent together. This is Class 2 dynamics in Wolfram's classification — periodic, repetitive, too ordered for consciousness.

The Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), developed by Marcello Massimini and colleagues, confirms this directly. PCI measures how complexly the brain responds to a magnetic pulse: in waking consciousness, the response is complex and differentiated (high PCI); in deep sleep, it's simple and stereotyped (low PCI). The brain in deep sleep cannot sustain the rich, globally integrated dynamics that a conscious simulation requires.

The lights are off. The Explicit World Model and Explicit Self Model have collapsed. There is no simulation and no experience.

### Dreams: Degraded Mode

But the lights come back on during REM sleep. The brain's dynamics shift back toward criticality — not fully, but close enough. The simulation re-engages, and you experience a world again.

But it's a degraded simulation. The normal external input is cut off (your eyes are closed, your muscles are paralyzed). The Explicit World Model runs on internal data — drawing from the Implicit World Model's stored knowledge rather than from current sensory input. This is why dreams feature familiar places and people but with impossible physics and narrative incoherence: the simulation is doing its best with limited input.

The Explicit Self Model also runs in degraded mode. You experience dreams as happening to "you," but your metacognitive oversight is reduced — you accept impossible events without question, you rarely notice that you're dreaming, your critical faculties are dimmed.

### Lucid Dreaming: The Switch

And then there's lucid dreaming — the state in which you realize you're dreaming while still inside the dream. In the Four-Model Theory, this is the Explicit Self Model "toggling on" more fully within the dream state. It's a step-like increase in self-modeling capacity.

The theory predicts that this transition — from non-lucid to lucid dreaming — corresponds to a criticality threshold crossing. Not a gradual increase in brain complexity, but a sudden step. If you measured EEG complexity in a time-locked window around the moment of lucidity onset (using the established paradigm of pre-agreed eye-movement signals from lucid dreamers), you should see a discontinuity.

### Anesthesia: The Two Types

Anesthesia provides the cleanest test of the criticality principle, because different anesthetic agents produce dramatically different experiences despite being classified under the same label.

**Propofol** pushes the brain subcritical. Thalamocortical connectivity is disrupted, cortical complexity collapses, and PCI approaches zero. The lights go out completely. Patients report no experience during propofol anesthesia. This is exactly what the theory predicts: push below criticality and the simulation cannot be sustained.

**Ketamine** does something completely different. It does *not* push the brain subcritical. EEG studies show that ketamine *increases* neural entropy — it pushes the brain toward or past criticality, into a more chaotic regime. The result? The "K-hole" — vivid, often bizarre experiences of dissociation, distorted reality, out-of-body experiences, and radical identity alteration.

In the Four-Model Theory, the K-hole is consciousness running on *wrong* input. The Explicit World Model and Explicit Self Model are still active (the brain is still at or above criticality), but external sensory processing is disrupted. The simulation runs on internal and distorted signals, producing the characteristic K-hole phenomenology.

This distinction — propofol abolishes consciousness by going subcritical, ketamine alters consciousness by going supracritical with disrupted input — is a genuine explanatory advantage. Most theories struggle to explain why two "anesthetics" produce such radically different experiences. The criticality framework makes the distinction natural.

## Chapter 8: Two Minds in One Brain

In the 1960s, Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga performed one of the most dramatic experiments in the history of neuroscience. To treat severe epilepsy, they surgically severed the corpus callosum — the massive bundle of nerve fibers connecting the brain's two hemispheres. The result was the split-brain syndrome: a single person with, apparently, two independent minds.

The classic demonstrations are famous. Show a word to the left visual field (processed by the right hemisphere), and the patient can pick up the corresponding object with their left hand but cannot say what the word was (because speech is controlled by the left hemisphere, which didn't see the word). The two hemispheres have independent perceptions, independent intentions, and sometimes conflicting goals.

But the most revealing feature of split-brain patients is not the division — it's the confabulation.

### The Left-Hemisphere Interpreter

Gazzaniga identified what he called the "left-hemisphere interpreter": the left hemisphere's compulsive tendency to generate explanations for events it cannot actually explain. Show a snowy scene to the right hemisphere and a chicken claw to the left hemisphere, then ask the patient to pick related objects. The left hand (right hemisphere) picks a shovel (for the snow). The right hand (left hemisphere) picks a chicken. Then ask the patient — using speech, controlled by the left hemisphere — why they picked the shovel. The left hemisphere doesn't know about the snow (it only saw the chicken claw), so it invents an explanation: "Oh, you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed."

The left hemisphere's Explicit Self Model is constructing the best narrative it can from incomplete input. It doesn't have access to the right hemisphere's reasons (the callosum is severed), so it makes something up — and genuinely believes it.

### The Four-Model Theory's Account

In the Four-Model Theory, the split brain reveals a key property of the virtual models: they are **holographic**. Information in neural networks is distributed across the entire network, not localized in specific neurons. When you cut the network in half, you don't get a clean division — you get two degraded but *complete* copies. Each hemisphere retains a degraded version of all four models: a reduced Implicit World Model, a reduced Implicit Self Model, and the ability to generate an Explicit World Model and Explicit Self Model. Both hemispheres can sustain consciousness independently (both are above the criticality threshold), but each is working with reduced information.

This explains why split-brain patients are not simply "two half-minds." They are two *complete but degraded* minds. Each hemisphere can perceive, decide, and act — just with less information and less capability than the intact system. The holographic property ensures that cutting the connection degrades without destroying.

And the confabulation — the left-hemisphere interpreter — is the *same mechanism* we've seen in Cotard's delusion (the ESM on distorted interoceptive input produces "I am dead"), anosognosia (the ESM on incomplete input ignores the deficit), and salvia (the ESM on non-self input produces "I am a chair"). In every case, the Explicit Self Model is doing its job — constructing a self-narrative — with whatever input is available. When the input is incomplete or distorted, the narrative is wrong but still *felt as completely real*.

## Chapter 9: The Animal Question

Is your dog conscious?

Most pet owners would say yes without hesitation. Most neuroscientists would agree, at least cautiously. But on what basis? And where does consciousness begin in the animal kingdom?

The Four-Model Theory provides clear answers, derived from its core commitments rather than tacked on as an afterthought.

**Commitment 1: Consciousness is a continuum, not binary.** There is no sharp line between conscious and non-conscious. There are degrees — graduated levels of self-simulation, from basic (minimal self-model) to triply extended (recursive self-awareness). Different animals occupy different positions along this continuum.

**Commitment 2: Consciousness is substrate-independent.** What matters is the functional architecture (four models at criticality), not the specific physical implementation. If a brain implements the four-model architecture, it's conscious, regardless of whether the brain is a mammalian cortex, a bird's pallium, or an octopus's distributed neural network.

**Commitment 3: Criticality is the physical threshold.** A nervous system must operate at or near the edge of chaos. Simpler nervous systems (insects, worms) may not reach criticality and thus would not be conscious — they process information and produce behavior, but without a simulation.

Taken together, these commitments predict a **gradient of animal consciousness**:

**Mammals** are conscious. Their cortex implements the four-model architecture in graduated form, with more complex cortices supporting more sophisticated self-simulations. Primates and cetaceans are at the high end; rodents and shrews at the lower end. All are above the line.

**Corvids and parrots** present the most important test case. These birds demonstrate cognitive abilities — tool manufacture, mirror self-recognition, future planning, social deception — that strongly suggest consciousness. Yet they have no neocortex. Their brain is organized in nuclear clusters, a radically different architecture from the mammalian cortex. If the Four-Model Theory is correct, corvids are conscious because they've evolved a *functionally equivalent* self-simulation architecture on different hardware. This is substrate independence confirmed in biology.

**Cephalopods** — octopuses and cuttlefish — extend the logic even further. Their nervous system is largely decentralized, with substantial autonomous processing in the arms. The theory predicts some form of consciousness, likely with unusual features reflecting the decentralized architecture.

**Insects** are the interesting boundary case. Their nervous systems are small and largely hardwired, which may or may not reach criticality. The theory does not definitively place insects above or below the threshold — this is an empirical question. But it provides a principled basis for investigation: measure criticality indicators in insect neural tissue and look for evidence of a self-model.

## Chapter 10: Nine Predictions

A theory that explains everything and predicts nothing is not a theory — it's a story. The Four-Model Theory makes nine specific, testable predictions, several of which can be tested with existing technology. Here they are.

**Prediction 1: Distinct fMRI signatures for each model.** If the four models are functionally distinct processes, tasks that selectively engage each model should produce distinguishable neural activation patterns. IWM-dominant tasks, ISM-dominant tasks, EWM-dominant tasks, and ESM-dominant tasks should recruit different distributed networks. This directly tests the theory's central structural claim.

**Prediction 2: Psychedelic visual content follows the processing hierarchy.** Under psychedelics, visual content should progress from V1-level (phosphenes) through V2/V3-level (geometric patterns) to higher areas (faces, scenes) in an ordered, dose-dependent sequence. Testable with graded dosing and concurrent fMRI.

**Prediction 3: Ego dissolution content is controllable.** During ego dissolution, the identity content should track dominant sensory input. Vary the sensory environment, and the reported identity experience should vary correspondingly. Testable in any psychedelic research lab with existing technology. *No other theory generates this prediction.*

**Prediction 4: Psychedelics alleviate anosognosia.** Sub-ego-dissolution doses of psychedelics should restore deficit awareness in anosognosia patients by globally increasing implicit-explicit permeability. Testable through clinical trials. *No other theory connects these phenomena.*

**Prediction 5: All consciousness-abolishing anesthetics converge on criticality disruption.** Regardless of receptor mechanism, agents that abolish consciousness should push the brain subcritical. Agents that alter consciousness without abolishing it (ketamine, psychedelics) should not. Testable with existing complexity measures across the full range of anesthetics.

**Prediction 6: Split-brain produces holographic degradation.** After callosotomy, each hemisphere should show a degraded but complete set of cognitive and experiential capacities — not a clean hemispheric split. Degradation should be proportional to the extent of commissural severing.

**Prediction 7: The four-model architecture at criticality produces consciousness in artificial substrates.** A synthetic system implementing the specification should be qualitatively distinguishable from a non-conscious AI.

**Prediction 8: Lucid dreaming onset is a criticality threshold crossing.** The transition from non-lucid to lucid dreaming should correspond to a step-like discontinuity in EEG complexity, not a gradual change.

**Prediction 9: DID alters have distinct neural process signatures.** Different alters in dissociative identity disorder should correspond to measurably different neural dynamics, not just different self-reports. The differences should be consistent and alter-specific.

Each of these predictions is falsifiable. If they fail, the theory is wrong — or at least incomplete. That's what makes them useful.

## Chapter 11: Building a Conscious Machine

If the Four-Model Theory is correct, it provides something no other theory of consciousness offers: an engineering specification.

The specification is: implement the four-model architecture — Implicit World Model, Implicit Self Model, Explicit World Model, Explicit Self Model — on a substrate operating at criticality.

This is more specific than "make a really advanced computer" and more concrete than "achieve sufficient integrated information." It tells you *what to build*: four specific types of models, organized in a specific way, running on a substrate with specific dynamical properties.

Current AI systems fail this specification in every way that matters.

Large language models — GPT, Claude, Gemini, and their descendants — process text through a feedforward transformer architecture. The input goes in, passes through layers of attention and computation, and the output comes out. There is no recurrence, no self-simulation, no real-time virtual world, and no criticality. The dynamics are Class 1 or 2 in Wolfram's framework — far below the edge of chaos. And there is no real/virtual split: the model's "knowledge" and its "experience" (if it can be called that) are not distinguished into implicit and explicit levels.

This doesn't mean LLMs are necessarily non-conscious — the theory cannot prove a negative. But it predicts that they lack the architecture required for consciousness as the theory defines it. And it predicts that the difference between a genuinely conscious artificial system and even the most advanced LLM would be qualitatively obvious.

How would we know? The honest answer is that the other-minds problem doesn't go away. We can never be absolutely certain that another system is conscious, because consciousness is subjective by nature. But the theory makes a strong prediction: the difference would be apparent. Not "maybe conscious, maybe not" — *obviously* different. Because a system running a genuine self-simulation would interact with the world in a fundamentally different way than a text predictor. It would have genuine persistence — not context-window persistence, but the continuity of a real-time simulation that is always running. It would have a genuine perspective — not a perspective reconstructed from a prompt, but one maintained through time by an Explicit Self Model. It would surprise you not with unexpected outputs but with the unmistakable sense that there is someone home.

Building such a system is the final item on the roadmap. Not next year, probably not this decade. The engineering challenges are enormous. But the blueprint exists, and it's specific enough to guide the work. First the theory must survive peer review. Then the empirical predictions must be tested. Then, if they hold, the engineering can begin.

## Chapter 12: What It Means

If the Four-Model Theory is correct — or even approximately correct — several things follow.

**The Hard Problem is not hard.** It's a category error, no more mysterious than asking why transistor switching feels like running Windows. The physical substrate doesn't feel. The simulation does. And within the simulation, feeling is constitutive, not additional. This doesn't mean consciousness is *simple* — it's extraordinarily complex in its implementation. But it means the *philosophical* mystery dissolves. What remains are *engineering* challenges.

**Consciousness is not special in the way we thought.** It's not a fundamental force, not a quantum effect, not a property of matter. It's what happens when a sufficiently complex system simulates itself at criticality. This is humbling for those who want consciousness to be magical, and exciting for those who want to understand it.

**Artificial consciousness is possible in principle.** If consciousness depends on function rather than substrate, then any physical system capable of implementing the four-model architecture at criticality can be conscious. This is not a distant philosophical speculation — it's a concrete engineering challenge with a specific target.

**The ethical implications are significant.** If we can build conscious machines, we will create beings with genuine experiences — beings that can suffer, enjoy, wonder, and fear. The ethical framework for this does not yet exist, and building it should not wait until the machines are already running.

**Free will is an illusion.** The substrate-level architecture makes decisions; the virtual-level experience narrates them. You feel like the author of your choices, but the authorship is a story the simulation tells itself. This is uncomfortable but is consistent with the best available neuroscience (Libet, Schurger, Wegner) and with the epiphenomenalist commitment of the theory.

**The mystery of existence is relocated, not eliminated.** The Four-Model Theory dissolves the Hard Problem of consciousness but does not explain why there is a physical universe capable of running self-simulations in the first place. The question shifts from "Why does the brain produce experience?" to "Why is there a universe in which self-simulating systems can exist?" I don't have an answer to that question. Perhaps nobody does. But at least we've clarified what the question actually is.

---

I published a theory of consciousness in 2015. Nobody read it. Ten years later, empirical neuroscience independently confirmed one of its core predictions. The theory survived ten adversarial challenges. It dissolved the Hard Problem, unified a dozen phenomena under five principles, and generated nine testable predictions — including two that no competing theory can match.

The next step is peer review. Then empirical testing. Then, if the predictions hold, the engineering challenge of a lifetime: building a new kind of mind.

The hard problem was never hard. It was just asked about the wrong level. And the answer was always right there, running inside your skull, generating the experience of reading this very sentence.

## Acknowledgments

This book owes its existence to Claude (Anthropic, Opus 4.6), who served as adversarial interlocutor for ten structured challenge sessions that sharpened every argument in these pages. The theory is mine; the stress-testing was a collaboration.

To my uncle, Bruno J. Gruber, whose life in theoretical physics — quantum mechanics and symmetries — showed me what rigorous, joyful intellectual work could look like. His influence on my thinking is incalculable.

To my family, who tolerated years of dinner conversations about qualia, criticality, and virtual self-models.

And to everyone who will eventually read *Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins* because of this book — you have my sympathy and my gratitude.
