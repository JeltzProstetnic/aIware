# The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness

**Matthias Gruber's theory of consciousness — consolidated from *Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins* (2023) and refined through 10 adversarial challenges (2026).**

---

## 1. Core Definition

Consciousness is the ability of an entity (organism or machine) to create a model of itself, to relate that model to itself, and to interact with it.

It is not a thing the brain *has*. It is a thing the brain *does*: it runs a real-time self-simulation.

## 2. The Four-Model Architecture

The theory identifies four nested models arranged along two axes: **scope** (all vs. self) and **mode** (implicit vs. explicit).

| Model | Abbreviation | Scope | Mode | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Implicit World Model** | IWM | Everything | Implicit/learned | The substrate's total accumulated knowledge — stored in synaptic weights (or equivalent). Never directly conscious. |
| **Implicit Self Model** | ISM | Self only | Implicit/learned | The substrate's self-knowledge — body schema, skills, habits, personality. Never directly conscious. |
| **Explicit World Model** | EWM | Everything | Explicit/simulated | The conscious world — the real-time simulation of reality. What you *experience*. |
| **Explicit Self Model** | ESM | Self only | Explicit/simulated | The conscious self — the real-time simulation of "I." Who you *are*. |

### The Two Sides

- **Real side** (IWM + ISM): Physical, learned, implicit. Stored in the substrate's structure. No experience. "Lights off."
- **Virtual side** (EWM + ESM): Simulated, explicit, phenomenal. Transient electrochemical activity (or equivalent). This is where experience lives.

### Key Properties

- The **Implicit Self Model is NEVER conscious**. There is no homunculus. The ESM is a projection, not a viewer.
- **Information becomes conscious** when it is transferred from the ISM into the EWM (implicit → explicit transfer).
- The ESM is **redirectable** — it is a virtual process that needs input. Disrupt normal self-referential input, and it latches onto whatever is available (see: Psychedelics, Salvia evidence below).
- The virtual models have **software-like properties**: they can be forked, duplicated, reconfigured, and run in parallel (see: DID, Split-brain below).

### Graduated Levels

Consciousness is not binary but graduated:
- **Basic consciousness**: Minimal self-simulation
- **Simply extended**: First-order self-observation (the system models itself)
- **Doubly extended**: Second-order self-observation (the system models itself modeling itself)
- **Triply extended**: Third-order self-observation (recursive self-awareness)

Each level corresponds to additional layers of recursive self-modeling.

## 3. Virtual Qualia — Dissolving the Hard Problem

**The central insight**: Qualia are not mysterious properties of physical matter. They are a virtual "sixth sense" — the way the simulated self (ESM) perceives its own states within the simulation (EWM).

This dissolves the hard problem of consciousness:

- **The physical substrate does NOT feel anything.** The IWM and ISM operate without experience. "Lights off."
- **The simulation DOES feel.** Within the EWM/ESM, qualia are simply what self-perception produces.
- **"Why does the physical process feel like something?"** is therefore a **category error**. The physical process *doesn't* feel. The simulation does, and within the simulation, qualia are constitutive — they are what the virtual self-sense *is*.

This is **not** standard illusionism (Dennett/Frankish), which says qualia are illusions. Qualia are *real within the simulation* — they just don't exist at the physical level. It is a two-level ontology: substrate has no experience, simulation has genuine experience.

**Analogy**: Asking why neuronal firing "feels like red" is like asking why transistor switching "feels like running Windows." The transistors don't run Windows — the virtual machine does. The neurons don't feel red — the simulation does.

## 4. Philosophical Commitments

These commitments were established through adversarial challenge and are internally consistent:

| Position | Commitment | Established |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Hard Problem** | Dissolution — category error (experience is virtual, not physical) | Challenge I |
| **Ontology** | Process physicalism — qualia are higher-order physical patterns | Challenge II |
| **Causal role** | Epiphenomenalism — consciousness observes, doesn't cause | Challenge II |
| **Emergence** | Weak — deducible in principle from substrate | Challenge II |
| **Threshold** | Continuum — no bright line, pragmatic ethical boundary | Challenge II |
| **Free will** | Illusion — the simulation narrates substrate-level decisions already made | Challenge II |
| **Quantum measurement** | Consciousness plays no role in collapse (entailment of epiphenomenalism) | Challenge II |
| **Substrate** | Independent — six-layer cortex is evolutionary accident, not requirement | Challenge II, Book |

## 5. Binding and Criticality

**Binding = emergent property of critical dynamics, not a separate mechanism.**

The substrate must operate in **Wolfram's Class 4 regime** — the edge of chaos:
- Class 1/2 (too simple) → no consciousness (feedforward networks at inference, deep sleep)
- Class 3 (too chaotic) → no coherent consciousness (seizure, some drug states)
- Class 4 (edge of chaos) → consciousness emerges (waking state, REM)

This was derived independently from Wolfram's cellular automaton framework, without knowledge of the empirical **ConCrit framework** (140 datasets linking consciousness to critical dynamics), the **Entropic Brain Hypothesis**, or the anesthesia/criticality literature. Two independent paths — theoretical reasoning and empirical neuroscience — converging on the same claim.

### Criticality as Unifying Principle

Consciousness is present whenever the substrate operates above the criticality threshold, absent below it:

| State | Criticality | Consciousness |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Waking | At/near critical | Full consciousness |
| REM/dreams | Near-critical, input-starved | Degraded consciousness (dream-level) |
| Deep NREM | Subcritical | Absent |
| General anesthesia (propofol) | Pharmacologically forced subcritical | Absent |
| Ketamine | NOT subcritical (increased entropy) | Present but disconnected (models on wrong input) |
| Psychedelics | At or past criticality | Present, altered (increased permeability) |
| Vegetative state | Subcritical | Absent (or covertly present if substrate still at criticality with output pathways damaged) |

### Holographic Storage

Information is distributed and non-local across the substrate — a standard property of neural networks (distributed representations, graceful degradation). Cutting connections degrades but does not destroy stored models.

## 6. The Implicit-Explicit Boundary

A key mechanism: the **permeability of the boundary between implicit models (IWM/ISM) and explicit models (EWM/ESM)**.

- **Normal waking**: Boundary is selectively permeable — conscious access to relevant information
- **Psychedelics**: Boundary becomes globally more permeable — intermediate processing stages (normally implicit) leak through to conscious experience. Explains the V1→V2→V3→fusiform progression (phosphenes → geometrics → faces → dream scenes)
- **Anosognosia**: Boundary is locally impermeable — ISM has the paralysis information, but transfer to EWM is blocked for that body region
- **Deep relaxation / pre-sleep**: Boundary gradually increases permeability — same bottom-up progression as psychedelics

## 7. Explanatory Range

The theory handles a wide range of phenomena from a small set of principles (criticality, virtual qualia, redirectable ESM, implicit-explicit permeability, model forking):

### Psychedelics (Challenge VI)
- **Ego dissolution** = ESM modified (running on wrong input), not absent
- **"Becoming a chair/fractal/movie character"** (salvia evidence): ESM latches onto whatever dominates available input. Dose-dependent, input-dependent, predictable.
- **Intensity = novelty**, not consciousness level. Profoundness is not fundamentally different from novelty.
- **Processing hierarchy becomes accessible**: Implicit→explicit permeability increase exposes intermediate processing stages.

### Anesthesia and Clinical Disorders (Challenge VII)
- **Propofol**: Pushes substrate subcritical → no consciousness
- **Ketamine**: Does NOT push subcritical but disrupts external input → disconnected consciousness (models on internal/distorted input)
- **Vegetative state**: Substrate subcritical. Covertly conscious patients = substrate at criticality with damaged output
- **MCS**: Substrate fluctuates around criticality threshold
- **Cotard's delusion**: ESM on severely distorted interoceptive input → "I am dead" (same mechanism as salvia)
- **Anosognosia**: Locally blocked implicit→explicit transfer (inverse of psychedelics)
- **DID**: Virtual models can be **forked** — multiple ESM configurations on one substrate

### Dreams (Challenge V)
- **Degraded mode** + additional functions (consolidation, rehearsal, simulation)
- Consciousness tracks criticality: REM = near-critical, deep NREM = subcritical
- **Lucid dreaming** = ESM toggled on within dream state — evidence for the software-like, digital quality of virtual models

### Split-Brain (Challenge VIII)
- Callosotomy = partial physical separation → virtual models **cloned** into two degraded but complete sets (holographic property)
- Gazzaniga's "left hemisphere interpreter" = left ESM narrating with incomplete input — same confabulation mechanism as Cotard's, anosognosia, salvia

### Animal Consciousness (Challenge X)
- **Gradient, not line.** Derived from continuum commitment + substrate independence + criticality.
- Mammals = graduated four-model implementation
- Corvids/parrots = different hardware (nuclear pallium, no cortex), same functional architecture = predicted conscious (substrate independence confirmed in biology)
- Cephalopods = same principle, even more divergent hardware

### Clinical Psychology (Challenge VII extension)
Virtual model forking and reconfiguration explains:
- CBT = virtual model reprogramming via substrate-level rewiring
- Phobias = virtual model misconfigurations, rewritable through exposure
- Placebo = parallel substrate effects (not downward causation)
- Psychosomatic illness = virtual model states correlating with substrate autonomic configurations
- Personality disorders = entrenched virtual model misconfigurations
- Conversion disorder = inverse of blindsight

## 8. Novel Testable Predictions

Eight predictions that follow from the theory's commitments and distinguish it from competitors:

| # | Prediction | Unique? | Testability |
|---|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Psychedelic content maps processing hierarchy** — ordered V1→V2→V3→fusiform progression correlating with dose | Yes | High |
| 2 | **"Becoming X" is controllable** — during ego dissolution, identity content tracks dominant sensory input | **Yes — no competitor handles** | High |
| 3 | **Psychedelics alleviate anosognosia** — global permeability increase compensates for local block | **Yes — cross-domain surprise** | Medium |
| 4 | **All anesthetics converge on criticality disruption** regardless of receptor mechanism | Shared with ConCrit | High |
| 5 | **Split-brain = holographic degradation** — degraded but complete copies, not clean hemispheric split | Yes | High |
| 6 | **Criticality + four models = consciousness signatures** in artificial substrates | Yes | Medium |
| 7 | **Lucid dreaming onset = criticality threshold crossing** (step-like, not gradual) | Partially shared | High |
| 8 | **DID alters = distinct neural process signatures** (not just behavioral differences) | Yes | High |

**Ultimate prediction**: Build a system to the theory's specification (four-model architecture at criticality). The qualitative difference between interacting with it and interacting with an LLM will be immediately, viscerally apparent.

## 9. Relationship to Existing Theories

The theory self-describes as an intersection of:
- **Multiple Drafts Model** (Dennett) — no Cartesian theater, consciousness is a process
- **Self-Model Theory** (Metzinger) — consciousness requires a transparent self-model
- **Neural network architecture** — four models implemented in (but not limited to) six-layer cortical structure

It differs from competitors on key points:

| Theory | Where Gruber differs |
|--------|---------------------|
| **IIT** | Rejects panpsychism, Φ as definition, mathematical formalism. Agrees posterior cortex matters. |
| **GNW** | Rejects prefrontal-parietal ignition as sufficient. Agrees on broadcasting but adds four-model structure. |
| **HOT** | Agrees on higher-order representation requirement. Differs: ESM is virtual, not just representational. |
| **PP** | Agrees brain is predictive. Differs: prediction is necessary but not sufficient — needs four-model architecture + criticality. |
| **AST** | Agrees consciousness involves self-model of attention. Differs: four models are more specific than "attention schema." |
| **Biological naturalism** (Seth, Searle) | Rejects substrate-dependence. Consciousness is substrate-independent if functional architecture is right. |

## 10. Open Questions

These are tracked research questions, not theoretical weaknesses:

1. **Are all four models virtual?** At least two (EWM, ESM) are virtual. The implicit models (IWM, ISM) might also be virtual in some sense. This is uncertain even to the author. Key question: if the implicit models are also virtual, what exactly IS the "real side"?

2. **Holographic binding formalization**: Distributed/non-local storage is a standard NN property, but needs formal treatment in the paper using established terminology (distributed representations, graceful degradation, attractor dynamics).

3. **Multi-level physical implementation**: The specific physical mechanism supporting criticality (cortical columns, standing waves, glia, microtubules) is an open empirical question. The theory is agnostic here.

4. **Minimum configuration for consciousness**: Can the four models partially dissociate? What's the minimum set for consciousness (vs. self-aware consciousness)? May require full connectome simulation to resolve.

## 11. Scoring Against the 8 Requirements

After the full 10-challenge stress test:

| Requirement | Score | How |
|------------|-------|-----|
| Hard Problem | **Strong** | Dissolved — category error, qualia are virtual |
| Explanatory Gap | **Strong** | Same dissolution — no gap to bridge |
| Boundary Problem | **Strong** | Learned self/world boundary via differential feedback |
| Structure | **Strong** | Four-model hierarchy with implicit/explicit dichotomy |
| Unity/Binding | **Strong** | Critical dynamics + holographic storage (standard NN property) |
| Combination/Emergence | **Strong** | Weak emergence, avoids panpsychist combination problem |
| Causal Role | **Strong** | Architecture is causally efficacious; consciousness is epiphenomenal ride-along |
| Meta-Problem | **Strong** | Self-model is structurally inaccessible → explains why we THINK there's a hard problem |

**8/8 strong.** No other theory in the current literature achieves this.

## 12. Key Evidence and Convergences

- **Independent convergence on criticality**: Gruber arrived at the criticality requirement from Wolfram's cellular automaton framework. The empirical ConCrit framework (140 datasets) arrived at the same conclusion from neuroscience data. Neither knew of the other.
- **Salvia divinorum phenomenology**: "Becoming a fractal/chair/movie character" is uniquely predicted by the redirectable ESM mechanism. No competitor theory handles this cleanly.
- **Anosognosia as inverse psychedelics**: Same mechanism (implicit→explicit permeability), opposite direction. No other theory connects these.
- **DID → clinical psychology bridge**: Virtual model forking explains a wide range of clinical phenomena under one principle.
- **COGITATE results (Nature, 2025)**: Neither IIT nor GNW fully confirmed. Posterior cortex favored — consistent with Gruber (consciousness lives in the virtual models, not in a specific brain region).
