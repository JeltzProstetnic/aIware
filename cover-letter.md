Dear Editors,

I am writing to submit the manuscript entitled **"The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness: A Simulation-Based Framework Unifying the Hard Problem, Binding, and Altered States"** for consideration as a Hypothesis and Theory article in *Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience*.

**Summary.** The manuscript presents a theory of consciousness in which experience is constituted by real-time self-simulation across four nested models (Implicit World Model, Implicit Self Model, Explicit World Model, Explicit Self Model), operating on a substrate at the edge of chaos. The theory's central claim is that qualia are virtual — they are properties of the simulation, not of the substrate — which dissolves the Hard Problem by revealing a category error in its standard formulation.

**Why this manuscript merits publication.** The paper makes three contributions that I believe are novel and timely:

1. **Comprehensive scope.** The paper systematically addresses eight requirements for a complete theory of consciousness (Hard Problem, Explanatory Gap, Boundary, Structure, Binding, Combination, Causal Role, Meta-Problem) and demonstrates that no existing theory addresses all eight. The Four-Model Theory does. A comparative analysis against IIT, GNW, HOT, PP, AST, and RPT makes this claim specific and verifiable.

2. **Novel testable predictions.** The theory generates nine predictions, several of which are unique — no competing theory can produce them. The most distinctive is that ego dissolution content during psychedelic experiences is controllable via sensory input (Prediction 2), and that psychedelics should alleviate anosognosia by globally increasing implicit-explicit permeability (Prediction 3). These cross-domain predictions connect psychopharmacology and clinical neurology under a single mechanism.

3. **Independent convergence on criticality.** The theory's criticality requirement was derived from Wolfram's computational framework in 2015 (Gruber, 2015), a decade before the empirical criticality literature converged on the same conclusion through Hengen & Shew's (2025) meta-analysis of 140 datasets and Algom & Shriki's (2026) ConCrit framework. This theoretical-empirical convergence from independent starting points provides strong independent support.

**Timeliness.** The manuscript engages directly with the most recent developments in consciousness science, including the COGITATE adversarial collaboration results (2025), the ConCrit framework (2026), biological computationalism (Milinkovic & Aru, 2025), and the Multiple Generator Hypothesis (Kirkeby-Hinrup et al., 2025). Given the field's current state — equivocal results from adversarial collaborations, open letters questioning falsifiability, and reviews questioning whether progress is being made — a theory that offers dissolution rather than incremental refinement may be particularly valuable.

**Declarations.** The manuscript has not been published previously, is not under consideration elsewhere, and the author has no conflicts of interest. The theory was originally published in German (Gruber, 2015); this manuscript presents a substantially expanded, refined, and updated treatment in English.

I believe this manuscript is well suited to the Hypothesis and Theory article type, which encourages bold theoretical contributions with testable implications. I look forward to the reviewers' assessment.

Sincerely,
