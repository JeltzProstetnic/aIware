Subject: Your criticality meta-analysis and an independent theoretical prediction from 2015

Dear Prof. Hengen,

Your meta-analysis with Dr. Shew — "Is criticality a unified setpoint of brain function?" — consolidated something I had predicted a decade earlier from a completely different starting point, and I wanted to bring this convergence to your attention.

In 2015, I published a theory of consciousness (in German, unfortunately) that derives a criticality requirement from Wolfram's computational classification: consciousness requires Class 4 dynamics because a real-time self-simulation demands sufficient computational complexity to be coherent yet sufficient structure to be unified. I arrived at this from theoretical first principles, without knowledge of the empirical criticality literature.

Your 2025 meta-analysis of 140 datasets established empirically what I had argued theoretically. The convergence — pure theory in 2015, large-scale empirical synthesis in 2025 — is, I believe, noteworthy.

I have written up the complete theory as a scientific paper: "The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness" (repository and PDF: https://github.com/JeltzProstetnic/aIware). The paper cites your work and discusses the convergence explicitly. Beyond the criticality claim, the theory generates nine testable predictions, including that all consciousness-abolishing anesthetics must converge on criticality disruption regardless of receptor mechanism — a prediction your framework is uniquely positioned to test.

I would be glad to discuss this further if you find the convergence interesting.

I am also seeking an endorsement for q-bio.NC on arXiv as I prepare to post the preprint. If after reviewing the paper you judge it appropriate for the archive, you can endorse me here: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=E9JU9T
