## Open

- [ ] [P5] **COGITATE commentary — PARKED**: Draft at `tmp/cogitate-commentary-draft.md` (1,587 words, limit 1,500). Target: NoC Spotlight Commentary. **Parked reason (Session 119):** NoC charges €2,144 APC (Oxford University Press open access). No waiver path for independent researchers. Not paying to fix their experimental design. Revisit only if fee structure changes or institutional affiliation acquired.
- [ ] [P1] **Seth BBS peer commentary** (deadline: June 12, 2026): Paper "Conscious artificial intelligence and biological naturalism" (BBS, April 2025). Submit formal commentary proposal via BBS call. Angle: predictive processing is substrate-neutral math — FMT provides the architectural specification Seth lacks.
- [ ] [P2] **Cosmology paper to SSRN**: Submit SB-HC4A to SSRN PhysicsRN. Preprint already on Zenodo.
- [ ] [P2] **Bochum conference registration**: Register by May 30 at RUB external registration site. Poster abstract already submitted. ATTEND IN PERSON — Melloni, Chalmers, Seth will be there.
- [ ] [P2] **Researcher outreach — Wave 2** (not yet contacted): Priority targets from `tmp/outreach-master-list-2026.md` — Megan Peters (UC Irvine), Michael Pitts (Reed), Georg Northoff (Ottawa), Olaf Blanke (EPFL), Pedro Mediano (Imperial), Andrea Luppi (Oxford/Cambridge), Robin Carhart-Harris, Viola Priesemann.
- [ ] [P2] **Conference submissions still open**: 6ICPH Porto (rolling, 250-word abstract, hybrid), SAGE Adaptive Behavior neurophenomenology (May 1, 2026), Models of Consciousness 7 Shanghai (TBA, monitor amcs-community.org).
- [ ] [P3] **Full FMT paper to journal** (AFTER NoC decision): Top target: *Physics of Life Reviews* (IF ~11-13). Backup: *Consciousness & Cognition*, *JCS*. Do NOT submit while NoC review is active. File: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (16,744 words).
- [ ] [P3] **arXiv preprint** (AFTER NoC decision): Needs endorsement (q-bio.NC). Endorsement link: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=E9JU9T. Submit BEFORE journal (65% citation boost). Requires syncing arxiv/paper.tex with current paper content.
- [ ] [P3] **Online presence / discoverability**: ResearchGate profile, Google Scholar profile (auto after arXiv/journal), ORCID link publications (0009-0005-9697-1665), LinkedIn post (`pop-sci/linkedin-post.md`, post after arXiv/journal).
- [ ] [P3] **Formalization papers** (3 roadmaps complete): FMT (`paper/fmt_formal/`), RIM (`paper/rim_formal/`), SB-HC4A (`paper/cosmology_formal/`). Need collaborators (computational neuroscientists) — potential outcome of outreach.
- [ ] [P3] **Pop-sci book — review pass**: English `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (~31,000 words, needs flow/consistency review). German `pop-sci/book-manuscript-de.md` (~2,400 lines, quality revision ~75% complete). KDP setup complete (ISBNs assigned, covers built).
- [ ] [P1] **Fix session-context.md / MEMORY.md missing from repo**: These files don't exist in the repo — likely excluded by `scripts/push.sh` filter or never committed from WSL. At minimum, the private remote should carry them. Check push.sh filtering rules and ensure `session-context.md` + `.cc-mirror/` memory files persist across machines via the private remote.
- [ ] [P4] **AC architecture design** (Roadmap Step 8): Implementation project at `~/aIware.implementation/`. Phase 1: Concept extraction from papers to architecture design. After publication wave settles.
- [ ] [P4] **Respond to peer review**: Prepare for likely objections: epiphenomenalism, lack of formalization, independent researcher status. ConCrit (Algom & Shriki) convergence is strongest defense.
