## ACTIONABLE NOW

### 1. COGITATE commentary — trim + submit
- Draft: `tmp/cogitate-commentary-draft.md` (1,587 words, limit 1,500)
- Target: NoC Spotlight Commentary via ScholarOne
- Trim ~90 words, then submit

### 2. Seth BBS peer commentary (deadline: June 12, 2026)
- Paper: "Conscious artificial intelligence and biological naturalism" (BBS, April 2025)
- Submit formal commentary proposal via [BBS call](https://www.anilseth.com/bbs-commentaries/)
- Angle: predictive processing is substrate-neutral math — FMT provides the architectural specification Seth lacks

### 3. Cosmology paper → SSRN
- Submit SB-HC4A to SSRN PhysicsRN
- Preprint already on Zenodo

### 4. Bochum conference registration
- **Register by May 30** at RUB external registration site
- Poster abstract already submitted
- ATTEND IN PERSON — Melloni, Chalmers, Seth will be there

### 5. Researcher outreach — Wave 2 (not yet contacted)
Priority targets from `tmp/outreach-master-list-2026.md`:
- Megan Peters (UC Irvine) — ASSC board, metacognition
- Michael Pitts (Reed College) — COGITATE PI
- Georg Northoff (Ottawa) — TTC, world-brain problem
- Olaf Blanke (EPFL) — bodily self-consciousness
- Pedro Mediano (Imperial) — synergistic information
- Andrea Luppi (Oxford/Cambridge) — multi-state brain dynamics
- Robin Carhart-Harris — psychedelic prediction testing
- Viola Priesemann — criticality empirical work

### 6. Conference submissions still open
| Conference | Deadline | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| 6ICPH Philosophy of Mind: AI (Porto) | Rolling | 250-word abstract, hybrid |
| SAGE Adaptive Behavior neurophenomenology | May 1, 2026 | Journal special issue |
| Models of Consciousness 7 (Shanghai) | TBA | Monitor amcs-community.org |

## AFTER NoC DECISION

### 7. Full FMT paper → journal submission
- Top target: *Physics of Life Reviews* (IF ~11-13)
- Backup: *Consciousness & Cognition* → *JCS*
- Do NOT submit while NoC review is active
- File: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (16,744 words)

### 8. arXiv preprint
- Still needs endorsement (q-bio.NC)
- Endorsement link: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=E9JU9T
- Submit BEFORE journal (65% citation boost)
- Requires syncing arxiv/paper.tex with current paper content

---

## MEDIUM-TERM

### 9. Online presence / discoverability
- ResearchGate profile — create account, upload preprints
- Google Scholar profile — auto-populates after arXiv/journal
- ORCID profile — link publications (already registered: 0009-0005-9697-1665)
- LinkedIn post — already written (`pop-sci/linkedin-post.md`), post after arXiv/journal

### 10. Formalization papers (3 roadmaps complete)
- FMT Formalization: `paper/fmt_formal/fmt-formalization.md`
- RIM Formalization: `paper/rim_formal/rim-formalization.md`
- SB-HC4A Formalization: `paper/cosmology_formal/sb-hc4a-formalization.md`
- Need collaborators (computational neuroscientists) — potential outcome of outreach

### 11. Pop-sci book — review pass
- English: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (~31,000 words, needs flow/consistency review)
- German: `pop-sci/book-manuscript-de.md` (~2,400 lines, quality revision ~75% complete)
- KDP setup complete (ISBNs assigned, covers built)

---

## LONGER-TERM

### 12. AC architecture design (Roadmap Step 8)
- Implementation project at `~/aIware.implementation/`
- Phase 1: Concept extraction from papers → architecture design
- After publication wave settles

### 13. Respond to peer review
- Prepare for likely objections: epiphenomenalism, lack of formalization, independent researcher status
- ConCrit (Algom & Shriki) convergence is strongest defense
