I should probably tell you who I am before I try to convince you that I've solved the hardest problem in science.

I'm Matthias Gruber, born 1978 in Feldkirch, Austria. I hold a master's degree in biomedical informatics from UMIT in Innsbruck -- no PhD, no lab affiliation, no grants. I fell in love with mathematics at eight, pivoted to physics at eleven (writing Conway's Game of Life on a 286 PC and discovering that a flat grid of dead and alive pixels could simulate entire worlds), and turned to consciousness at fourteen, when I concluded that the fundamental physics questions were stuck and my particular combination of self-taught skills could produce more value elsewhere. My uncle Bruno J. Gruber, a theoretical physicist specializing in quantum mechanics and symmetries, showed me what a life in rigorous theoretical work could look like. I read voraciously across philosophy of mind, cognitive science, neuroanatomy, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary biology -- not trying to master any one field, but trying to build a model of how all the pieces fit together. The four-model theory of consciousness crystallized when I was exactly twenty-five, walking across a bridge in Innsbruck, tears running down my face while laughing uncontrollably. One moment the pieces were scattered; the next, the whole architecture clicked into place.

Then almost a decade passed. I finished my degree (after abandoning medicine at the University of Innsbruck), founded and buried a custom software startup, held an applied research position in simulation and optimization, taught Wing Chun kung fu, earned a pilot license, completed Austrian commando training, and -- mainly -- partied. The only reason I eventually wrote a book was fear of forgetting: years of heavy partying were not doing my memory any favors. That book, *Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins* (The Emergence of Consciousness), was published in 2015, in German, at 302 pages of dense technical prose. It sold exactly zero copies. I brought the cubic meter of printed literature that had fed the theory to the trash on the same day the manuscript was finished.

Today I work at Ivoclar, a dental technology company in Liechtenstein, and I've finally returned to the theory. The aIware project is the result: six research papers, a pop-science book manuscript in English, three mathematical formalization roadmaps, and the long-term goal of building artificial consciousness based on the framework. The world caught up while I wasn't paying attention -- neuroscience confirmed the criticality prediction, AI development hit exactly the limitations the theory describes, and the field of consciousness studies remains wide open. This time, I'm not walking away.

## Note on Disambiguation

"Matthias Gruber" is a very common name in German-speaking academia. This is NOT Dr. Matthias Gruber of Cardiff University (the neuroscientist known for curiosity and memory research, ~3,300 citations), not the Matthias Gruber at FernUniversitat Hagen (planar-integrated optics), not the Matthias Gruber at TU Graz (XXZ spin chain physics), and not the Matthias Gruber at Detecon Switzerland (cybersecurity). This is the biomedical informatics researcher, software professional, and author born 1978 in Feldkirch, Austria -- ORCID [0009-0005-9697-1665](https://orcid.org/0009-0005-9697-1665).
