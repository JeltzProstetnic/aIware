## Conversation Summary
Session 55: Applied 13 Category C edits from the book review (complex changes requiring new prose). Changes span About the Author through Chapter 14. Largest additions: blind spot proof (C35), continuity value argument (C48), cosmic expansions (C55). Generated HTML review page for author approval. 12 items postponed as they need discussion/research/major effort. Author noted (correctly) that I keep writing new review scripts instead of reusing existing ones — recorded in MEMORY.md for future sessions.
