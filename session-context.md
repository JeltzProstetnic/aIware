# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-16 (Session 59)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Regenerate full paper .tex from canonical .md source

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 59 complete — full paper .tex regenerated
- **Progress**:
  - Regenerated `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.tex` from canonical `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`
  - Added 7 missing BibTeX entries to `references.bib` (Cybenko1989, Hornik1989, Brodmann1909, Lashley1950, Pribram1991, Engel2001, Gazzaniga1965)
  - Major new content added: Five-System Hierarchy (3.7.1), Cortical Automaton (3.7.2), Two Thresholds (3.7.3), Temporal dynamics/Libet reinterpretation, Cognitive learning, Six-layer architecture argument, Patchwork Principle, Anton's syndrome, expanded split-brain, rewritten Open Question 7
- **Pending**:
  - Homunculus figure (Ch.2 placeholder) — user creating
  - Book consistency read-through pass (~48,200 words)

## Book Review Items — ALL 53 DONE
All applied across Sessions 55-58. Only remaining book work:
- Homunculus figure (Ch.2 placeholder) — user creating
- Full paper .tex reconciliation — verify background agent output
- Book consistency read-through pass (~48,200 words)

## Key Files Modified This Session
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` — C49-51 subsection + minor edit
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.tex` — regenerated
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.pdf` — regenerated
- `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.tex` — reconciliation by background agent (verify)
- `paper/full/biorxiv/references.bib` — new bib entries added by background agent

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Check if full paper .tex reconciliation completed: `git diff --stat -- paper/full/biorxiv/`
3. If not completed, re-run reconciliation manually
4. Next priorities: remaining C items (C33, C45, C47 are most impactful)

## Other Project State (Unchanged)
- **Trimmed paper**: SUBMITTED to NoC 2026-02-13. Under review.
- **Full paper**: canonical at `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`. bioRxiv preprint submitted, awaiting acceptance.
- **Intelligence paper**: draft complete at `paper/intelligence/paper.md`. Preprint NOT yet posted — next preprint todo.
- **Outreach emails**: 2 sent (Hengen + Shriki). Remaining drafts not sent.

## Conversation Summary
Session 58: User asked to sync all book files from canonical .md, then continue with pending work. Rebuilt book .tex/PDF (2 sessions behind). Wrote C49-51 as new Ch.13 subsection (~1,100 words): sleep interruption challenges copy problem, personal knockout/amnesia experience, birth-without-prior-continuity argument, virtual-level-only transfer concept, brain's "programming language" as deepest unsolved problem. User corrected personal anecdote from anesthesia to martial arts knockout with amnesia. Full paper .tex reconciliation launched in background.
