# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 43, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Parallel workstream — intelligence paper polish, book manuscript expansion, cross-check

## What Was Done (Session 43)
- Intelligence paper polished for NIP: 7,811 → 7,400 words, 7 improvements, citations updated to bioRxiv
- Book: Chapter 10 expanded from 308 → 2,130 words (full prediction treatment)
- Book: Human virtualization section added to Ch 11 (+2,268 words)
- Book: Appendix A neuro primer rewritten (~300 → 2,200 words, 29 entries)
- Book: Epiphenomenalism contradiction fixed (4 edits → "dual evaluation architecture")
- Book: Cross-reference error fixed, table converted to LaTeX, 5 placeholder notes removed
- Cross-check report: tmp/paper-vs-book-reconciliation.md
- Flow review: tmp/book-flow-review.md
- Removed MCP health check from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

## Current State
- **Intelligence paper**: NIP-ready at paper/intelligence/paper.md (7,400 words). Needs .md → .docx conversion.
- **Long paper**: bioRxiv-ready (Matthias uploading this session)
- **Book manuscript**: ~33,000 words. Major additions integrated. Appendix B still TODO.

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### 1. Appendix B (intelligence model)
- Condense intelligence paper into ~2,000-3,000 word appendix
- Intelligence paper now finalized, so this is unblocked

### 2. Intelligence paper submission
- Convert .md → .docx (pandoc)
- AI tools declaration for cover letter
- Submit to New Ideas in Psychology

### 3. Computation classes discussion (FRESH SESSION)
- 5-class vs 4-class Wolfram
- Scope: book-only or feed back into paper?

### 4. Structural book decisions
- Split Chapter 7 at Clinical Mirror?
- Expand Chapter 8 (split-brain)?
- Two illustrations needed (inside simulation, Game of Life five-class)

### 5. Check bioRxiv upload status

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Next action: Write Appendix B from intelligence paper
3. Intelligence paper at paper/intelligence/paper.md (7,400 words, polished)
4. Review reports at tmp/paper-vs-book-reconciliation.md and tmp/book-flow-review.md
