## Session 28 Summary

### 1. About the Author Chapter — Revised with Verbatim Notes
All of Matthias's verbatim notes from Session 27 incorporated into `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md`:

**The Consciousness Turn** — Added:
- "we may never understand" → "challenge accepted" moment
- Uncle Bruno J. Gruber as inspiration (quantum mechanics, symmetries researcher)

**The Theory Crystallizes** — Rewritten:
- Crystallized at exactly 25, heaviest stone lifted
- Cubic meter of printed literature, Metzinger's help, instantaneous insight
- "My to-do list for my entire life was done"
- Bridge in Innsbruck moment: tears + uncontrollable laughter in broad daylight

**The Decade Gap** — Rewritten with real story:
- Abandoned medicine at UIBK, finished degree, founded/buried startup
- "Applied research" in simulation & optimization, martial arts, partying
- Book written out of fear of forgetting + tired of explaining verbally
- Zero motivation to promote

**Zero Copies** — Added cubic meter of literature going to trash
