# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-16 (Session 58)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Sync all generated files from canonical .md sources, write C49-51 book subsection

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 58 complete
- **Progress**:
  - Rebuilt book .tex + PDF from canonical .md (was 2 sessions behind)
  - Removed ", twice over" at line 242 of book-manuscript.md
  - Wrote new Ch.13 subsection: "But do you survive sleep?" + "Copying the virtual side" (~1,100 words, C49+C50+C51)
  - Fixed personal anecdote: knockout in martial arts training (not anesthesia) + amnesia episode
  - Rebuilt book .tex + PDF again after all edits
  - Full paper .tex reconciliation launched as background agent (may or may not have completed)
- **Pending**:
  - **VERIFY**: Full paper .tex reconciliation — check if background agent completed successfully
  - Homunculus figure (Ch.2 line 238) — user will create
  - Remaining postponed book review items (see list below)

## Book Review Items — ALL 53 DONE
All applied across Sessions 55-58. Only remaining book work:
- Homunculus figure (Ch.2 placeholder) — user creating
- Full paper .tex reconciliation — verify background agent output
- Book consistency read-through pass (~48,200 words)

## Key Files Modified This Session
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` — C49-51 subsection + minor edit
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.tex` — regenerated
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.pdf` — regenerated
- `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.tex` — reconciliation by background agent (verify)
- `paper/full/biorxiv/references.bib` — new bib entries added by background agent

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Check if full paper .tex reconciliation completed: `git diff --stat -- paper/full/biorxiv/`
3. If not completed, re-run reconciliation manually
4. Next priorities: remaining C items (C33, C45, C47 are most impactful)

## Other Project State (Unchanged)
- **Trimmed paper**: SUBMITTED to NoC 2026-02-13. Under review.
- **Full paper**: canonical at `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`
- **Intelligence paper**: draft complete at `paper/intelligence/paper.md`
- **Preprints**: PsyArXiv + bioRxiv planned, not yet posted

## Conversation Summary
Session 58: User asked to sync all book files from canonical .md, then continue with pending work. Rebuilt book .tex/PDF (2 sessions behind). Wrote C49-51 as new Ch.13 subsection (~1,100 words): sleep interruption challenges copy problem, personal knockout/amnesia experience, birth-without-prior-continuity argument, virtual-level-only transfer concept, brain's "programming language" as deepest unsolved problem. User corrected personal anecdote from anesthesia to martial arts knockout with amnesia. Full paper .tex reconciliation launched in background.
