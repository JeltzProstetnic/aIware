# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 46, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Regenerate intelligence paper LaTeX; fix epiphenomenalism drift; bioRxiv prep

## What Was Done (Session 46)
- Regenerated `paper/intelligence/paper.tex` from `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (+13 refs, -2 stale, ~6 new paragraphs, 25pp clean)
- Fixed epiphenomenalism language in `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (3 passages — LaTeX was already correct)
- Generated latexdiff highlighted PDF, user verified all changes
- User submitting `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.pdf` to bioRxiv NOW

## Key Discovery
Full paper LaTeX and markdown had drifted. LaTeX is the canonical source for the full paper. Markdown now synced.

## Canonical File Paths
- **Full paper LaTeX**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.tex` (CANONICAL for full paper)
- **Full paper PDF**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.pdf` (54pp, submission-ready)
- **Full paper Markdown**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (synced with LaTeX)
- **Full paper refs**: `paper/full/biorxiv/references.bib`
- **Trimmed paper (NoC)**: `paper/trimmed/noc/` (FROZEN — submitted 2026-02-13)
- **Intelligence paper**: `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (canonical, ~7,400 words)
- **Intelligence paper LaTeX**: `paper/intelligence/paper.tex` (CURRENT, 25pp)
- **Intelligence paper PDF**: `paper/intelligence/paper.pdf` (CURRENT)
- **Book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (~32,900 words)

## Next Steps (for Session 47)

### 1. Book work (USER REQUESTED as next task)
- Computation classes: 5-class vs 4-class Wolfram — book-only or feed back into paper?
- Structural decisions: split Chapter 7 at Clinical Mirror? Expand Chapter 8 (split-brain)?
- Two illustrations needed: inside simulation, Game of Life five-class
- Review pass for flow/consistency (~32,900 words)

### 2. Intelligence paper → NIP submission
- LaTeX and PDF current ✓
- Cover letter with AI tools declaration still needed
- Submit to New Ideas in Psychology

### 3. Confirm bioRxiv upload
- User submitting full paper now
