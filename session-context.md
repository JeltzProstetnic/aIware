# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 42, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Pre-flight long paper for bioRxiv; concept-level audit

## What Was Done (Session 42)
- Found and fixed 3 stale "epiphenomenal" references (limitations, conclusion, placebo) that contradicted Section 4.2's evolved "dual evaluation architecture" position
- Ran full bioRxiv pre-flight: compiles clean, all figures present, zero undefined citations
- Cleaned corrupted permission entry in `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Built and opened book manuscript PDF for review

## Current State
- **Long paper**: bioRxiv-ready. Pre-flighted PDF at `paper/full/arxiv/paper.pdf` and `Desktop/long-paper-preflight.pdf`
- **Book manuscript**: All 48 feedback items applied (Session 41). PDF builds successfully.
- **Conversation log**: Session 42 appended

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### 1. bioRxiv submission
- Paper is ready — upload PDF + source
- Select subject area (neuroscience)

### 2. Computation classes discussion
- Gruber's 5-class extension vs Wolfram's 4 classes
- Scope: book-only or feed back into long paper?

### 3. Book finalization
- **Neuro appendix (#35)**: Full basic neuro intro for non-specialists in our language/framework + rich illustrations (NOT just terminology)
- **5 figure placeholders** need actual illustrations
- **#49**: Human virtualization → manuscript text (Ch 11/12)
- **#38**: PDF table rendering fix
- **Flow/consistency review pass**
- **META-TASK cross-check**: long paper vs book

### 4. Intelligence paper → preprint (BEFORE book intelligence appendix)
- Finalize intelligence paper for preprint submission
- THEN write intelligence appendix for book (last book step)

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Next action: bioRxiv submission of long paper
3. Paper is at `paper/full/arxiv/paper.tex`, compiles clean, all checks passed
