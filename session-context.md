# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 49, in progress)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Book edits from Session 48 plan + future publication brainstorming

## What Was Done (Session 49)

### Book Edits (Completed)
1. **Appendix C: Five Classes of Computation** — NEW appendix (~150 lines) drafted from Session 48 conversation. Covers: Wolfram's 4 classes, Gruber's 5-class split argument, why deterministic automata can't produce randomness (pigeonhole/Kolmogorov argument), Class 5 as boundary of mathematical expressibility, Cantor analogy for hierarchies of randomness, implications for consciousness, brain uses all 4 classes as tools.
2. **Chapter 5 trimmed** — Removed detailed 5-class descriptions (~25 lines), replaced with concise edge-of-chaos summary (~12 lines) referencing Appendix C. Added "brain uses all four classes as tools" paragraph. Preserved Game of Life personal anecdote, criticality section, cortical automaton section.
3. **Chapter 6: V1-IT table added** — Brief 7-row table in the permeability gradient section showing visual area → normal function → psychedelic signature. References expanded table in Appendix A.
4. **Appendix A expanded** — Added full V1-IT visual hierarchy table with Brodmann areas, receptive field sizes, normal functions, and psychedelic signatures. Added V4, V5/MT, fusiform gyrus, anterior IT entries. Added cross-references to Chapters 6 and Appendix C.
5. **Table of contents updated** — Added Appendix C entry.

### Stats
- Book manuscript: 1,311 → 1,487 lines (+176 lines)
- Net effect: Chapter 5 shorter (trimmed ~13 lines), Chapter 6 gained table (+12 lines), Appendix A expanded (+22 lines), Appendix C new (+150 lines)

## Canonical File Paths
- **Full paper LaTeX**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.tex` (CANONICAL for full paper)
- **Full paper PDF**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.pdf` (54pp)
- **Full paper Markdown**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (synced with LaTeX)
- **Full paper refs**: `paper/full/biorxiv/references.bib`
- **Trimmed paper (NoC)**: `paper/trimmed/noc/` (FROZEN — submitted 2026-02-13)
- **Intelligence paper**: `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (canonical, ~8,757 words)

- **Intelligence paper PDF**: `paper/intelligence/paper.pdf` (CURRENT)
- **Book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (~1,487 lines, 13 chapters + 3 appendices)

## User TODOs (Noted, Not Yet Acted On)
1. **Future publications brainstorm**: Think about potential papers beyond consciousness + intelligence. Cosmology? Mathematics? User suspects "all of this is connected" and may unlock a Weltformel.
2. **Website cross-check**: Re-read user's website (read once before), extract to local markdown for easier LLM digestion. Check for connections across all the user's ideas.

## Next Steps
- Commit book edits, push to both remotes
- Address user's "todo for later" items (future publications, website cross-check)
- Book review pass for flow/consistency (remaining from Session 48 plan)
- Confirm bioRxiv DOI
- Intelligence paper → NIP submission

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Book edits from Session 48 plan are DONE (Appendix C, Ch5 trim, Ch6 table, Appendix A)
3. Need to commit + push
4. Then address user's future publication and website tasks
