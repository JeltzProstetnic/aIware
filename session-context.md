- **Cover letter**: Drafted (cover-letter-noc.md)
- **Next steps plan**: Written (next-steps.md)
- **Git**: Email files untracked + gitignored, cover letter gitignored

## What Changed This Session
1. Created paper-noc.md (trimmed from 12,077 → 9,471 body words)
2. Fixed all 5 emails: Metzinger false attribution, links to direct PDF, SEND NOTEs, Carhart-Harris arXiv ask
3. Removed email files from public git tracking
4. Drafted NoC cover letter
5. Created next-steps.md action plan

## Immediate User Actions Needed
1. **Register ORCID** at orcid.org (required for NoC submission)
2. **Check ASSC membership** for 20% APC discount
3. **Send Wave 1 emails** (Shriki + Hengen) with PDF attached
4. **Wait for arXiv endorsement** before submitting to NoC (if possible)

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Key files: paper-noc.md (submission version), cover-letter-noc.md, next-steps.md
3. Email files are on disk but NOT in public git
4. arxiv/paper.tex still needs syncing with paper-noc.md trimming
5. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes: `git push origin main && git push private main`
