# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 31, second half)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: German→English book comparison + plan integration

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Save state and restart — context full
- **Progress**: Comparison report complete, integration plan defined
- **Pending**: Execute integration (next session)

## Session 31 (Second Half) — What Happened

### Comparison Report
- Extracted full text from German book PDF (299pp, 687KB) using PyMuPDF
- Opus agent compared German book chapter-by-chapter against English manuscript
- Full report at: `/home/jeltz/aIware/tmp/comparison-report.md`
- Finding: ~60-70% of German book content absent from English manuscript

### Mathematician Challenge — NEW IDEA (Matthias)
Three relationships between holography and Class 4 automata:
1. **Hologram → Class 4**: Holographic substrate produces critical dynamics. Probably what the brain does. The "boring" one.
2. **Automaton = Hologram**: A Class 4 automaton whose rule structure IS holographic. **"If this exists, I'm almost certain it IS the universe"** — Matthias's claim. Weltformel candidate.
3. **Automaton → Hologram**: A Class 4 automaton that produces holographic patterns as emergent behavior. Could also be the universe but less fundamental than #2.

**Where it goes:**
- Book Ch. 5 (brief teaser)
- Book Ch. 12 (full challenge in open questions)
- Full paper §9 (formal conjecture as 5th open question)

## NEXT SESSION TODO — German Book Content Integration

### Source: `/home/jeltz/aIware/tmp/comparison-report.md`

User instruction: "All except deliberately omitted. Some stuff should also go into the long paper."

### HIGH PRIORITY — Must integrate into book

#### H1. The Cortical Automaton Concept (German Ch. 8.5, 12)
**Where**: Book Ch. 5 (edge of chaos) — expand to make explicit that cortical electrical activity IS a Class 4 automaton
**What**: The pattern of neural firing across the cortex viewed as a Wolfram Class 4 cellular automaton operating in many-thousand-dimensional space. The automaton is NOT consciousness — consciousness arises from interplay between automaton and cortex.
**Also for long paper**: Yes — this is a core theoretical concept

#### H2. The Holographic/Patchwork Principle (German Ch. 4.3, 11, 12)
**Where**: Book Ch. 3 (virtual side) or new section, + Ch. 5
**What**: Neural networks are locally holographic (within Brodmann areas), fractally self-similar (cortical columns), globally emergent. "Patchwork hologram" concept. Cutting hologram in half → complete image at lower resolution. Karl Lashley's engram experiments.
**Also for long paper**: Yes — foundational concept

#### H3. The 40/20 Hz Framework + Libet Reinterpretation (German Ch. 8.5)
**Where**: Book Ch. 12 (free will section) or Ch. 7
**What**: Conscious loop at 20 Hz, unconscious at 40 Hz. Libet's results need no "backdating" because consciousness receives everything with the same delay. Kuhn & Brass (2009) — even veto function is retrospectively interpreted.
**Also for long paper**: Consider for §4.2 (free will) or §6

#### H4. Cognitive vs. Reinforcement Learning (German Ch. 8.5)
**Where**: Book Ch. 9 (animal question) or Ch. 2 or new
**What**: Consciousness enables fundamentally different learning — inducing theories from observations. Poison mushroom example: reinforcement learning fails for lethal stimuli; only cognitive learning via 3PP works. The cave-neighbor humor.
**Also for long paper**: Yes — strengthens the evolutionary advantage argument

#### H5. Five-System Hierarchy (German Ch. 12)
**Where**: Book Ch. 2 or Ch. 3
**What**: physical → electrochemical → proteomic → topological → virtual. Clean layered framework.
**Also for long paper**: Consider for §3

#### H6. "Observe the Cortical Automaton" (German Ch. 12)
**Where**: Book Ch. 5 (after edge of chaos) — experiential instruction
**What**: Close eyes in dark room, wait for afterimages to fade, see flickering colored points = cortical automaton's V1 activity. Progression from noise to hallucinations as more areas recruited.
**Also for long paper**: Probably not (too pop-sci)

#### H7. Six-Layer Cortex Insight (German Ch. 6)
**Where**: Book Ch. 2 (brain anatomy, when written) or existing chapters
**What**: Cortex has six layers; three beyond what's needed for info processing → extra layers enable self-modeling. This is the architectural bridge from "neural network" to "self-simulating system."
**Also for long paper**: Yes — important architectural argument

#### H8. Mathematician Challenge — Automaton/Hologram (NEW)
**Where**: Book Ch. 5 (teaser) + Ch. 12 (full challenge) + Paper §9
**What**: Three relationships (hologram→Class4, automaton=hologram, automaton→hologram). The second may be the Weltformel.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY — Compelling supporting material

#### M1. Wegner "I Spy" Mouse Experiment (German Ch. 8.5)
**Where**: Book Ch. 12 (free will section)
**What**: Participants believed they controlled a cursor actually controlled by confederate. Imagining action creates illusion of having performed it.

#### M2. Anosognosia Mechanism Detail (German Ch. 8.5)
**Where**: Book Ch. 7 (clinical mirror section) — expand existing
**What**: Motor system sends expected feedback to consciousness BEFORE actual feedback arrives. When actual feedback absent (paralysis), expected feedback goes uncorrected. Patient who "claps" with paralyzed hand.

#### M3. Personal Anecdotes (German Ch. 5.4, 8.3, 9)
**Where**: Scattered through book where relevant
**What**:
- Sleepwalking: writing left-handed at desk, walking walls in circles (Ch. 7 sleep section)
- Hearing two "voices" during extreme exhaustion — one encouraging, one destructive (Ch. 12 free will or Ch. 7)
- Lucid dreaming as a fish (Ch. 9 animal question — experiencing non-human perspective!)
- Synesthesia / "seeing music" (Ch. 6 or wherever qualia discussed)

#### M4. Coffee/Sugar Free Will Thought Experiment (German Ch. 9)
**Where**: Book Ch. 12 (free will section)
**What**: Assign yes/no to even/odd numbers, use random sequence to decide — fails because we unconsciously anticipate. Plus the amnesia patient always choosing same "random" associations.

#### M5. Baldwin Effect (German Ch. 10)
**Where**: Book Ch. 9 (animal question) or About the Author
**What**: Learned behavior indirectly influences genetics. The hair-loss/fire humorous example.

#### M6. Missing Thought Experiments
**Where**: Various chapters
**What**:
- Random letter sequence with amnesia → Ch. 12 free will
- "Wake up as someone else" → Ch. 3 or Ch. 4
- "Permanently on Salvinorin A" → Ch. 6
- "Composite hologram" → wherever holography goes

#### M7. Additional German-book content
- nSAI/nSU dogmas (named prejudices against AI consciousness / self-understanding) → Ch. 1 or Ch. 11
- The "infinite loop" computer joke → Ch. 11
- Kanzi bonobo stories in full (requesting sister for ice cream, private dance) → Ch. 9
- "36th of August" prediction joke → Ch. 9
- Alien Hand Syndrome / Anarchic Hand → Ch. 7 clinical
- Charles Bonnet Syndrome → Ch. 7 clinical
- Rubber hand illusion → Ch. 3 or Ch. 7
- Deja vu explanation (template memory matching) → wherever memory discussed
- Default mode network and creativity → wherever relevant
- "Three discrepancies" self-improvement model → Ch. 12

### ALSO FOR LONG PAPER (paper/full/*)
Items to add to full paper:
- Cortical automaton concept (H1)
- Holographic/patchwork principle (H2)
- 40/20 Hz + Libet reinterpretation (H3) — consider
- Cognitive vs reinforcement learning (H4)
- Five-system hierarchy (H5) — consider
- Six-layer cortex insight (H7)
- Mathematician challenge: automaton/hologram conjecture (H8)

### BASIC BRAIN ANATOMY CHAPTER
User confirmed Ch. 2 "Brain Anatomy" will be written (already in C3 TODO). This will naturally absorb some German Ch. 7 content (thalamus, cortex, Brodmann areas, ARAS, hippocampus, Broca/Wernicke, prefrontal cortex, Phineas Gage, visual pathways, rubber hand illusion, etc.)
