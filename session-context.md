## What Session 70 Did
1. Fixed stale book subtitle in .tex, build script, and outline ("How Your Brain Creates Consciousness" → "The Architecture of Consciousness, Computation, and the Cosmos"). Recompiled book PDF. Added line break after "of" on title page.
2. Generated PDFs for Papers 4 (FMT) and 5 (RIM) via pandoc+pdflatex. Updated all README links to point to PDFs with [Markdown source] companions.
3. Added cosmology bridging text to three README sections (Theory in 60 Seconds, 10 Challenges, Background) that previously covered only consciousness.

## TOP TODO (Next Session)
1. Intelligence paper: trim ~358 words, write highlights, generate .docx, submit to *New Ideas in Psychology*
2. NoC resubmission (trimmed paper .docx ready)
3. Outreach emails (3 ready to send)
4. Review cosmology chapters for flow/consistency (author review pass)
5. Consider whether computational atoms insight warrants a separate short paper

## Recovery Instructions
1. Nothing pending from Session 70. All work committed.
2. Start with TOP TODO list above.
