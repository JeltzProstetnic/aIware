### A. HIGH PRIORITY — Must add

#### A1. Graduated Levels of Consciousness (paper §3.5)
**Where in book**: New subsection in Ch. 2 (The Four Models) or Ch. 3 (The Virtual Side)
**What**: The paper defines four levels of recursive self-modeling:
- **Basic consciousness**: Minimal self-simulation. EWM + rudimentary ESM. Phenomenal experience exists but self-awareness is thin.
- **Simply extended**: First-order self-observation. The system models itself. Aware that it experiences.
- **Doubly extended**: Second-order. The system models itself modeling itself. Enables metacognition, reflection.
- **Triply extended**: Third-order. Models itself modeling itself modeling itself. Deepest self-awareness, philosophical reflection, and — crucially — the prerequisite for even *asking* "what is consciousness?"
**Why it matters**: Answers the reader's immediate question "how conscious are different creatures?" Connects to Ch. 9 (animals), explains why humans can do philosophy of mind. Currently completely missing.

#### A2. The Meta-Problem Dissolution (paper §3.8)
**Where in book**: New section in Ch. 4 (after the Hard Problem dissolution) or new mini-chapter
**What**: Why does consciousness *seem* so mysterious? Because the ISM is structurally inaccessible to the ESM. The conscious self cannot observe its own substrate. When the ESM tries to model the basis of its own experience, it encounters a principled opacity — the implicit models that generate the simulation are not part of the simulation. So the ESM concludes the mechanism must be non-physical or inexplicable.
**Key line from paper**: "The result is the persistent intuition that something is being 'left out' of any physical explanation: the ESM cannot find the mechanism within its own simulation, so it concludes the mechanism must be non-physical or fundamentally inexplicable."
**Why it matters**: This is the "after-dinner wow" moment. Dissolving the Hard Problem is the theory's headline; explaining why the mystery *persists* despite the dissolution is what makes readers actually believe it. Currently completely missing.

#### A3. "This Is NOT Illusionism" (paper §3.4, para starting "This is not illusionism...")
**Where in book**: In Ch. 4 (Why It Feels Like Something), after the Hard Problem dissolution, before or after the circularity section
**What**: Explicit statement that the theory is NOT illusionism (Dennett/Frankish). Illusionism says qualia are illusions — there's nothing it's like. The Four-Model Theory says qualia are *real within the simulation*. Two-level ontology: substrate has no experience, simulation has genuine experience. Both levels are physical.
**Why it matters**: Every reader will think "so you're saying consciousness is an illusion?" and the book currently doesn't address this. The distinction is crucial: qualia are REAL, just not at the level people expect.

#### A4. Clinical Psychology Bridge (paper §6.6)
**Where in book**: New chapter or new section in existing chapter (could be part of Ch. 7 "When the Lights Go Out" or a new Ch. 7b). This material is completely absent.
**What**:
- **CBT** = virtual model reprogramming. Repeated corrective experience drives substrate-level rewiring (synaptic plasticity), modifying the ISM, which changes the ESM's self-model. Therapy literally rewires your implicit models.
- **Phobias** = EWM misconfigurations. Threat representation exceeds the IWM's evidence base. Exposure therapy updates the IWM to correct the EWM.
- **Placebo effect** = consistent with epiphenomenalism. Placebo activates substrate-level expectation circuits (endogenous opioid release) that operate in parallel with — not caused by — conscious hope. Correlation is real but non-causal.
- **Conversion disorder** = inverse blindsight. In blindsight, substrate processes visual info without including it in EWM. In conversion disorder, the EWM models a deficit (paralysis, blindness) that the intact substrate doesn't have.
**Why it matters**: EVERY reader has experience with therapy, phobias, or placebos. This is the most relatable application of the theory. Currently completely absent.

#### A5. Cotard's Delusion — Developed (paper §6.2)
**Where in book**: In Ch. 6 (psychedelics chapter) alongside the salvia/anosognosia discussion, or in a new clinical chapter
**What**: Patients believe they are dead, that their organs have disappeared, that they don't exist. The theory explains: the ESM receives severely distorted interoceptive input. Deprived of normal embodied signals, the ESM constructs the best model it can — and "I am dead" is its interpretation of the absence of normal body signals. Same mechanism as salvia's "I am a chair," applied to clinical context.
**Key insight**: Cotard's, salvia, anosognosia, and split-brain confabulation are ALL the same mechanism — an ESM constructing a narrative from incomplete or distorted input.
**Why it matters**: The book mentions Cotard's in one clause in Ch. 8. It deserves full development — it's a dramatic and memorable example.

#### A6. Covert Awareness / Cognitive Motor Dissociation (paper §6.2)
**Where in book**: In Ch. 7 (When the Lights Go Out), in the anesthesia/clinical section
**What**: Owen et al. (2006) — patients diagnosed as vegetative who are actually conscious but can't express it. The theory distinguishes:
- **Truly vegetative**: Subcritical substrate → no consciousness
- **Covertly conscious**: Critical substrate with damaged output pathways → consciousness present but unexpressible
The distinction should be detectable via criticality measures (PCI). This has practical medical implications.
**Why it matters**: Emotionally powerful, medically important. A person trapped conscious inside an unresponsive body. The theory provides a principled way to tell the difference. Currently absent.

#### A7. The Clock Analogy for Epiphenomenalism / Rich Free Will Treatment (paper §4.2)
**Where in book**: Expand the one-paragraph "Free will is an illusion" in Ch. 12
**What**: The paper has a brilliant clock analogy: consciousness is like the hands and face of a clock — the gear train drives the mechanism, but without the display the clock cannot function *as a clock*. The virtual models are the substrate's mechanism for consequence-observation and future-oriented adaptation. Remove the display and the mechanism still runs, but it no longer serves its purpose.
**Also**: Free will reframing — your will IS real but only partially known to yourself. The substrate continuously optimizes the organism's existence, and this optimization *is* the individual's will. Even self-destruction reflects the system's optimization rather than its failure.
**Also**: Zombie argument (not possible — four-model architecture necessarily instantiates simulation), Mary's Room (she gains acquaintance with a virtual quale), evolutionary argument (selection targets functional capabilities; phenomenal character is constitutive of those capabilities).
**Why it matters**: The book's current treatment is a one-paragraph bullet point that says "free will is an illusion" with no nuance. The paper's version is much richer, more defensible, and less likely to alienate readers.

### B. MEDIUM PRIORITY — Would significantly enrich

#### B1. Software-Like Properties as Explicit Framework (paper §3.3)
**Where in book**: End of Ch. 2 or beginning of Ch. 3, as a "preview" of what the virtual models can do
**What**: The paper explicitly lists four software properties of the virtual models:
1. **Forking**: A single substrate can run multiple ESM configurations (→ DID)
2. **Cloning**: Physical separation produces degraded but complete copies (→ split-brain)
3. **Redirecting**: Disrupt normal input and the ESM latches onto whatever dominates (→ psychedelics/salvia)
4. **Reconfiguring**: Therapeutic interventions modify virtual models through substrate rewiring (→ CBT)
**Why it matters**: Creates a unifying framework that ties Chapters 6-8 together. Currently these are scattered across chapters with no explicit connection.

#### B2. DID Developed (paper §6.2)
**Where in book**: In Ch. 8 (Two Minds in One Brain) as a companion to split-brain, or in a new clinical chapter
**What**: DID = virtual model forking. The substrate runs multiple ESM configurations — multiple self-models — that alternate in controlling the simulation. Each alter is a distinct configuration with its own self-narrative, emotional profile, and behavioral patterns. Not a metaphor: distinct alters should correspond to distinct neural activity patterns.
**Why it matters**: Currently only a one-sentence mention as Prediction 9. DID is fascinating, relatable, and demonstrates the software-like quality of the virtual models.

#### B3. Consciousness States Table (paper §5.3, Table 3)
**Where in book**: In Ch. 7 (When the Lights Go Out), as a summary
**What**: A table mapping every consciousness state against criticality, model status, and consciousness:
| State | Criticality | Models | Consciousness |
Includes: waking, REM, NREM, propofol, ketamine, psychedelics, vegetative, covert awareness, minimally conscious
**Why it matters**: The book has all this as narrative but never unifies it. A table gives the reader a reference to come back to.

#### B4. Open Questions (paper §9)
**Where in book**: New section near the end (after Ch. 12 or as part of it)
**What**: Four honest unresolved questions:
1. Are all four models virtual? (The implicit models are "models" too — what's the real bottom?)
2. Mathematical formalization needed (currently qualitative, not quantitative)
3. Which physical mechanism supports criticality? (Cortical columns? Thalamocortical waves? Glial modulation?)
4. Minimum configuration for consciousness (Can you have EWM without ESM? What's the minimum?)
**Why it matters**: Shows intellectual honesty. Readers respect a theory that admits its limits. Currently absent.

#### B5. Free Will Deep Treatment (paper §4.2) — see A7 above
Already covered in A7. The depth of the paper's treatment (clock analogy, zombie argument, Mary's Room, evolutionary argument, "will is real but partially known") is a significant enrichment.
