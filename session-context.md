# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 41, in progress)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Apply 48 book manuscript feedback items from Session 37

## Current State
- **Active Task**: COMPLETE — all 48 feedback items applied to book manuscript
- **New feedback**: #49 (human virtualization / substrate transfer) captured, NOT yet applied to manuscript text
- **Pending**: Conversation log entry, commit, push

## What Was Done (Session 41)

### Feedback items applied to `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md`:

**About the Author / Preface**: #1 (credentials humor), #26 (interdisciplinary binding)
**Chapter 1**: #2 (right question reframing)
**Chapter 2**: #3 (optical illusions), #4 (bubble diagram placeholder), #5 (five nested systems simplified), #6 (five-layer stack placeholder), #7 (implicit/explicit accessibility), #8 (real/virtual expansion + fMRI + invisibility), #9 (category error → accessible), #10 ("exactly right" cut), #11 (simple real/virtual figure placeholder), #12 (six-layer genetic duplication), #13 (octopus example)
**Chapter 3**: #14 (video game YOU), #15 (SD illustration placeholder), #16 (consciousness is a process)
**Chapter 4**: #17 (illusionism self-refuting), #18 (bullet HURTS), #19 (ISM/ESM plain language), #20 (permeability leaks), #21 (mystery as prediction), #22 (confabulation binds continuity)
**Chapter 5**: #23 (theory "right"→"good"), #24/30/30b-e (Gruber 5-class replacing Wolfram 4-class, hologram-automaton reorder), #25 (GoL figure placeholder), #27 (concentrate→relax), #28 (permeability callback), #29 (global concentrate fix)
**Chapter 6**: #31 (psychedelics disclaimer), #32 (safe alternative—meditation), #33 (neurotoxicity distinction), #34 (salvia danger), #37 (lucid dreaming), #39 (salvia=death experience), #44 (salvia time dilation)
**Chapter 7**: #36 (sleepwalking one episode), #41 (blindsight/Anton's vivid)
**Chapter 8**: #42 (decision-making dual evaluation), #43 (avalanche + march stories)
**Chapter 12**: #45 ("I don't have an answer"→yes you do), #46 (hologram-automaton conjecture expanded)
**Acknowledgments**: #47 (Claude role honest)
**Global**: #23 (right→good audit), #29 (concentrate→relax audit)
**Structural**: #35 (neurology appendix skeleton), #48 (intelligence appendix skeleton), TOC updated

### Items deferred/noted:
- **#38** (table rendering in PDF): Build script fix needed for `tmp/build_book_pdf.py` — not a text edit
- **#35, #48**: Appendix skeletons created; need fleshing out in future session
- **#49**: New feedback captured; needs manuscript text in Ch 11/12

### Figures still needed (placeholders inserted):
- Simple bubble diagram (based on German book p.64)
- Five-layer stack diagram
- Simple real/virtual split diagram
- Game of Life illustrations (5 classes)
- Stable Diffusion illustration (Matthias to generate)

## Key File Locations
- **Book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (extensively edited this session)
- **Feedback log**: `tmp/book-feedback-session37.md` (now includes #49)
- **Long paper**: `paper/full/arxiv/paper.tex` (NOT edited this session — META-TASK cross-check still pending)

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file for orientation
2. Manuscript has all 48 feedback items applied — verify by spot-checking
3. Still pending: conversation log entry, commit, push
4. Future work: flesh out appendices, apply #49, cross-check META-TASK items against long paper, fix PDF build script (#38)
