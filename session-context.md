# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 48, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Theoretical discussion — 5-class computation scheme vs Wolfram's 4 classes

## What Was Done (Session 48)
- Pure theoretical discussion (no file edits to book/paper)
- Formally compared Wolfram's 4 classes with Gruber's 5 classes
- Identified where Wolfram placed fractals (Class 3, lumped with chaos)
- Established the split: Wolfram Class 3 → Gruber Class 3 (fractal) + Gruber Class 5 (chaotic)
- Discussed fractal function in the brain: scale measurement, texture analysis in V2-V4
- Mapped visual areas V1-IT with psychedelic signatures
- Confirmed fusiform gyrus = part of IT (straddles V4/IT border)
- Argued "chaotic" CAs are actually high-complexity fractals (finite rules → finite info → must self-similar)
- Class 5 (true randomness) requires rules inexpressible in mathematics
- Class 5 structure: UNKNOWN (not "none") — Cantor analogy for hierarchies of randomness
- Full conversation saved verbatim to conversation log

## Next Steps (for Session 49)

### 1. Appendix C: Five Classes of Computation (NEW)
- Draft from Session 48 conversation
- Content: Wolfram's 4 classes, the split argument, computational reducibility, determinism/fractal argument, Class 5 boundary of expressibility, Cantor analogy
- This is original contribution — flag as such

### 2. Chapter 5: Trim computation section + add V1-IT table
- Move detailed 5-class treatment to Appendix C
- Keep brief mention: "edge of chaos required"
- Add brief V1-IT table in psychedelic progression section
- Add note that brain uses all 4 classes as tools

### 3. Neuroscience appendix: Expanded V1-IT table
- Full version with receptive field sizes, functions, psychedelic signatures

### 4. Book review pass
- Flow and consistency across 34,000+ words
- Cross-reference verification (13 chapters + appendices)

### 5. Confirm bioRxiv DOI
- User submitting full paper — check if DOI available

### 6. Intelligence paper → NIP submission
- Cover letter needs bioRxiv DOI reference
- Submit after preprint posted

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Read Session 48 in conversation log — full verbatim conversation preserved
3. Next task: Draft Appendix C from the conversation content
4. Then trim Chapter 5 and add V1-IT table
5. All commits should be pushed to both remotes
