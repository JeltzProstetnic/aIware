# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-17 (Session 63, post-autocompact)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Preprint submissions (Zenodo done, PhilSci pending), add formalization papers, expert-proof the "four models" language — ALL DONE

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 63 wrap-up complete. Ready for next session.
- **Progress**:
  - PsyArXiv rejected consciousness paper ("speculative philosophy"). Intelligence paper still live.
  - Zenodo: consciousness paper uploaded, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18669891
  - PhilSci-Archive: consciousness paper submitted, awaiting moderation
  - Fixed DOI links everywhere: use https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg (resolves correctly)
  - Sorted references alphabetically in full paper .md (6 violations fixed, 109 refs)
  - Deleted stale arxiv/ dir and paper-changes.* artifacts
  - Added Paper 3: FMT formalization (paper/fmt_formal/fmt-formalization.md, ~6,000 words)
  - Added Paper 4: RIM formalization (paper/rim_formal/rim-formalization.md, ~6,200 words)
  - README updated: all 4 papers listed, PsyArXiv/Zenodo/PhilSci status corrected
  - Book: Added Appendix E ("Why Four Models?") for neuroscientists, with inline parenthetical in Ch.2
  - Full paper: "Principled minimum" paragraph added to Section 3.2, PDF rebuilt
  - Trimmed paper: tracked insertion added for NoC review
  - All committed and pushed to both remotes

## Pending (Next Session)
- PhilSci-Archive: check moderation status (submitted 2026-02-17)
- NoC resubmission: DO NOT resubmit until preprints confirmed live
- Trimmed paper .docx needs regeneration if tracked insertion accepted
- DOIs still not added to reference lists (low priority)
- Implementation project Phase 1 (concept extraction) — `/home/jeltz/aIware.implementation/`

## Key Decisions Made
- PhilSci-Archive chosen over SocArXiv (dedicated consciousness category, PhilPapers indexing)
- Zenodo for DOI (instant, no moderation), PhilSci for community visibility
- "Four models = principled minimum" caveat: book gets Appendix E, papers get inline paragraph in Section 3.2
- biorxiv/ folder stays (links shared to friends), arxiv/ deleted

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. All Session 63 work is committed and pushed
3. Check PhilSci-Archive moderation status
4. Do NOT resubmit to NoC until preprints confirmed live
5. Next major work: Implementation project Phase 1 or NoC resubmission prep

## Conversation Summary
Session 63. PsyArXiv rejected consciousness paper. Chose PhilSci-Archive + Zenodo as alternatives. Zenodo DOI obtained (10.5281/zenodo.18669891). PhilSci submitted, pending. Added two formalization papers (FMT + RIM). Fixed DOI links across all files. Sorted full paper references. Deleted stale arxiv/ dir. Added Appendix E to book for neuroscientist caveat about "four models = minimum." Added principled-minimum paragraph to full paper Section 3.2 and tracked insertion to trimmed paper. All committed and pushed.
