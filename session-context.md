# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-22T18:30Z (Session 99 — END)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Research cognitive-feeling.jp, update German tagline, outreach cleanup

## What Was Done
- Researched JST CREST "Cognitive Feeling" project — strong FMT promotion target
  - Key contacts: Keisuke Suzuki (Hokkaido, sense of presence/VR), Yukie Nagai (U Tokyo, developmental robotics)
  - Project runs until March 2027, uses predictive processing framework
- Updated German book tagline (line 9 of book-manuscript-de.md): expanded to four idiomatic questions + "Kino im Kopf"
- Removed Metzinger from outreach emails (user's decision)
- Created Gmail MCP setup guide → pushed to nuc project (`/home/jeltz/nuc/docs/gmail-mcp-setup.md`)
- Added Gmail MCP task to nuc TODO

## State at End
- German book: tagline updated, no PDF rebuild needed (content-only change in front matter)
- Outreach: Metzinger removed, Suzuki/Nagai emails not yet drafted
- Gmail MCP: setup guide in nuc project, needs Google Cloud Console work first

## Pending for Next Session
1. Draft outreach email to Keisuke Suzuki (highest-value new contact)
2. Optionally draft Yukie Nagai email (AC implementation angle)
3. Rebuild German book PDF if tagline change matters for review
4. Still pending from Session 98: draft Wendland podcast pitch, fix "zwei Jahrzehnte" in templates

## Recovery Instructions
1. Check if commit went through (session may have ended before push)
2. For Suzuki email: see cognitive-feeling.jp/en/members/ and his publications at sites.google.com/view/keisukesuzuki/
3. Gmail MCP setup is in nuc project, not here
