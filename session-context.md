| M6 | Thought experiments (3 items, ~700 words) | Ch. 4, 6, 12 |
| M7 | Additional content (9 items, ~1,800 words) | Ch. 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12 |

**Full paper** (`paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`):
- **Before**: ~12,600 body words
- **After**: ~14,400 body words (+1,800 words)
- 7 content additions + 9 new references
- Submitted trimmed version UNTOUCHED

### Full paper additions:
- Five-system hierarchy (new §3.7.1)
- Cortical automaton (new §3.7.2)
- Holographic patchwork principle (expanded §5.2)
- Cognitive vs RL learning (§4.2)
- Six-layer cortex insight (§4.4)
- 40/20 Hz + Libet reinterpretation (§4.2)
- Mathematician challenge as 5th open question (§9)

## Key File Locations
- **Pop-sci book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (26,500 words)
- **Full paper**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (14,400 body words)
- **Trimmed LaTeX (SUBMITTED, do NOT modify)**: `paper/trimmed/arxiv/paper.tex`
- **Comparison report**: `tmp/comparison-report.md`
- **German book full text**: `tmp/german-book-full-text.txt`

## Ongoing TODOs (from prior sessions, NOT done this session)
- arXiv: blocked at endorsement wall
- Outreach emails: drafted, NOT sent
- Intelligence paper (Angle 2): decided, not started
- Pop-sci book: needs review pass of all new content
- Book Ch. 2 brain anatomy: flagged for future writing
- LinkedIn article: polished, not posted

## Recovery Instructions
1. Session 32 integration is DONE
2. Next: review the integrated content for quality/flow
3. Consider a full read-through of the manuscript
4. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes
