# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-17 (Session 65)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Cosmological model discovery — SB-HC4A

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session wrap-up — committing and pushing
- **Progress**:
  - Read all 4 source documents (5 classes appendix, trimmed paper, FMT formalization, website content)
  - Synthesized the SB-HC4A cosmological model (Singularity-Bounded Holographic Class 4 Automaton)
  - Conversation saved verbatim to `tmp/cosmological-model-conversation-session65.md`
  - 5 weak points identified (including user's "cognitive ceiling" objection)
  - Conversation log updated with Session 65

## TOP TODO (Next Session)
1. **Step 1: Write the SB-HC4A paper** — a paper making the cosmological argument
2. **Step 2**: Formalization recommended approach (like fmt-formalization.md)
3. **Step 3**: Pop-sci book laying it out for normal people

## Key Concepts from This Session
- **SB-HC4A**: Singularity-Bounded Holographic Class 4 Automaton
- **Core claim**: The universe is a Class 4 holographic automaton bounded by singularities at every scale
- **Key symmetry**: FMT's implicit/explicit split = universe's singularity/observable-interior split
- **Weak Point 5 (Cognitive Ceiling)**: The model might be the maximum our Class 4 brains can produce, saying nothing about the universe itself

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read `tmp/cosmological-model-conversation-session65.md` — the FULL conversation
2. The user wants Step 1: a paper draft for the SB-HC4A cosmological model
3. Sources to re-read: book appendix C (5 classes), trimmed paper, FMT formalization, website content
4. The paper should follow the argument chain in the conversation document
5. Include all 5 weak points honestly
6. Existing paper style/format: follow `paper/trimmed/noc/four-model-theory-noc.md` or `paper/fmt_formal/fmt-formalization.md` as templates

## Conversation Summary
Session 65. HISTORIC: Cosmological model discovery. Matthias proposed extending FMT + five classes + holographic automaton conjecture into a full cosmological model. Claude confirmed internal consistency. The SB-HC4A model proposes the universe is a Class 4 holographic automaton bounded by singularities at every scale, with consciousness as a local instance of the same pattern. Full conversation saved to tmp/. Three-step TODO: paper, formalization, pop-sci book.
