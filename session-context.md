# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-19 (Session 83)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Content pass for book → print-on-demand readiness

## What Session 83 Did
1. Content pass on book manuscript — comprehensive review
2. Em-dash audit: all 239 cuts already applied (Session 82 was thorough). 774 remaining = all KEEPs
3. Tic check: here's (19), let me (4), I want (8), I need (3) — all natural voice, no changes needed
4. Cross-reference verification: all chapter refs correct after Ch 14 split
5. TOC fix: added missing Coda entry
6. ABOUT.md fixes: updated 58K→62K words, 15→16 chapters, swapped author photo (art-consciousness.jpg → matthias-gruber.jpg)
7. Copied correct author photo from Windows: `1749406479497.jpg` → `figures/matthias-gruber.jpg`
8. Chapter balance check: 1,695–5,623 words (reasonable)
9. Chapter transition check: all smooth
10. Consistency check: clean (no repeated words, no orphaned refs, terminology consistent)

## Current Stats
- Chapters: 16, ~62,331 words
- Em-dashes: 774 (all intentional keeps)
- Content: PRINT-READY (text-level)

## Priority: Book → Print-on-Demand (FIRST PRINT)
User confirmed this is the top priority over intelligence paper submission.

## Submission Status
- NoC: RESUBMITTED, awaiting feedback
- SSRN: SUBMITTED, awaiting acceptance
- Zenodo cosmology: PUBLISHED (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18698606)
- PsyArXiv intelligence: PUBLISHED (https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg)

## Remaining TODOs (Priority Order)
1. **POD layout formatting**: trim size (6"×9"), margins (gutter), front matter (copyright page), chapter openings
2. **Illustrations**: B&W for cost. Current figures (SVG/PNG) need B&W conversion for print
3. **Cover art**: User has it already — need to locate and integrate
4. **Build**: Rebuild PDF with POD-ready layout
5. **ISBN**: User has ISBNs from Lulu — may need new one
6. **Platform**: KDP / Lulu / IngramSpark setup
7. Intelligence paper: trim ~358 words, highlights, .docx, submit to NIdP (deferred)
8. Outreach emails: 3 ready (Priesemann, Metzinger, Carhart-Harris) (deferred)

## GitHub Notes
- Social preview image: user uploaded via Settings (shows on link shares, not sidebar)
- `art-consciousness.jpg` still in figures/ (abstract art, may delete later)
- `matthias-gruber.jpg` added (correct author photo)

## Recovery
1. Read this file + MEMORY.md
2. Book: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` — content is print-ready
3. Next step: POD layout formatting (trim size, margins, front matter)
