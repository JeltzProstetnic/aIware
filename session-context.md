# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-16 (Session 57)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Fix inconsistent four-models intro in book Ch.2

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 57 complete — Ch.2 four-models intro rewritten
- **Progress**:
  - Rewrote "Your Brain's Four Representations" intro in `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (lines 234-244)
  - New flow: simple nets → brain models → homunculi (Penfield) → implicit models → key insight: they generate explicit models (digital twin analogy) → four models
  - Added Penfield homunculus figure placeholder
  - Added Appendix A reference for cortical organization
  - Committed and pushed to both remotes
- **Pending**:
  - C49-51: Copy problem subsection (virtual-level copy, brain programming language, major meditation) — new subsection in Ch.13
  - Book .tex regeneration needed after all edits finalized
  - Homunculus figure needs to be created

## Key Files Modified
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` — rewrote four-models intro

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. C49-51 are the only remaining book review items — single new subsection in Ch.13
3. Homunculus figure placeholder at line 238 needs an actual figure
4. After all edits finalized: regenerate .tex, rebuild PDF, commit, push

## Other Project State (Unchanged)
- **Trimmed paper**: SUBMITTED to NoC 2026-02-13. Under review.
- **Full paper**: canonical at `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`
- **Intelligence paper**: draft complete at `paper/intelligence/paper.md`
- **Preprints**: PsyArXiv + bioRxiv planned, not yet posted

## Conversation Summary
Session 57: User identified inconsistency in Ch.2 "Your Brain's Four Representations" — passage said "each of these twins has two layers" then described two axes, not layers. User specified the correct pedagogical flow: learning builds models → brain builds implicit models of world and body (homunculi as grounding) → these generate virtual/explicit models → four models total. Rewrote the passage accordingly, keeping the digital twin analogy but repositioning it as the mechanism for how implicit models generate explicit ones.
