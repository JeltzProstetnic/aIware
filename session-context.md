# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 34, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Execute all three priorities + wrap up for restart

## Current State
- **Active Task**: None — session complete
- **Progress**: Preprint guide done, manuscript reviewed, intelligence refinement planned, 2 critical fixes applied
- **Pending**: LaTeX/PDF sync, intelligence paper edits, remaining manuscript fixes

## Session 34 — What Happened

### PsyArXiv/bioRxiv Preprint Guide — COMPLETE
Key finding: **Can only choose ONE** — bioRxiv won't accept papers already on other servers.
Recommendation: **bioRxiv** (better fit for neuroscience, broader audience).
Process: Register → upload PDF → category "Neuroscience" → CC-BY 4.0 → 24-72hr screening → DOI.
OUP confirms: preprints allowed during peer review.
Guide saved to: `tmp/preprint-submission-guide.md`

### Manuscript Flow Review — COMPLETE (read-only analysis)
Full 26,500-word read-through produced 20 findings:
- **3 CRITICAL**: Dangling Ch. 16 reference (FIXED), Tarski/Gödel error (FIXED), unfulfilled five-hierarchy promise
- **7 IMPORTANT**: ESM mechanism triple-coverage, chapter length imbalance, Preface/About overlap, etc.
- **10 MINOR**: Ch. 4-5 transition, Ch. 12 overloaded, clinical section voice, etc.
Full report: `tmp/manuscript-flow-review.md`

### Intelligence Paper Refinement Plan — COMPLETE (read-only analysis)
Cross-referenced draft against 388-line literature review:
- **8 of 10 must-cite references missing** — specific insertion locations for each
- **~1,410 words of additions** proposed → paper goes from 7,858 to ~9,268 words (under 10K limit)
- **Tier 1 (critical)**: Flynn reversal + Austrian paradox + growth mindset critique
- **Tier 2 (important)**: van Geert process ontology + Balboni adaptive intelligence + Sternberg meta-intelligence
- **Tier 3 (strengthening)**: Hilger neural dynamics + LLM reasoning update + Duckworth framing
- **Self-plagiarism check: CLEAN** — mushroom example not reproduced
Full plan: `tmp/intelligence-paper-refinement-plan.md`

### 3rd "Gruber, forthcoming" Citation — Already Present
Agent found all 3 citations already in place (lines 298, 645, 682). Previous session's verification miscounted.

### Two Critical Manuscript Fixes — APPLIED
1. Line 66: Removed dangling "Chapter 16" reference → now just "The recursive loop"
2. Line 170: "Tarski's incompleteness theorems" → "Gödel's incompleteness theorems"

## Open Tasks for Next Session
1. **LaTeX/PDF sync** — transfer Session 32c cross-references to LaTeX versions, recompile PDFs
2. **Intelligence paper edits** — execute Tier 1-3 from refinement plan (~1,410 words)
3. **Remaining manuscript fixes** — 1 critical (five-hierarchy promise) + 7 important from flow review
4. **bioRxiv submission** — follow the guide in tmp/preprint-submission-guide.md
5. Ongoing: arXiv endorsement, outreach emails

- **Full paper**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (14,591 body words)
- **Intelligence paper**: `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (7,858 words, complete draft)
- **Trimmed LaTeX (SUBMITTED, do NOT modify)**: `paper/trimmed/arxiv/paper.tex`
- **NEW — Preprint guide**: `tmp/preprint-submission-guide.md`

## Recovery Instructions
1. Session 34 is DONE — all analysis complete, two critical manuscript fixes applied
2. FIRST TASK next session: LaTeX/PDF sync (user explicitly requested before commit)
3. Then: Execute intelligence paper refinement plan (Tier 1 first)
4. Then: Remaining manuscript fixes from flow review
5. Then: bioRxiv submission (follow guide)
6. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes
