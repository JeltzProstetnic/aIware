# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-14 (Session 29, end)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Intelligence paper revisions — remove royal "we", add learnability argument

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session complete. Ready for restart.
- **Progress**: All Session 29 tasks completed, committed, pushed to both remotes.
- **Pending**: Next session TODO below.

## Session 29 Summary

### Changes Made
1. **Royal "we" eliminated** — all 20+ instances replaced with "I"/"this paper"/"the model"/passive throughout both MD and LaTeX
2. **New Section 6: The Learnability of Intelligence** (5 subsections):
   - 6.1 A Structural Prediction (K learnable, M learnable, P rarely the bottleneck)
   - 6.2 Why Performance Is Not the Bottleneck (compound interest metaphor)
   - 6.3 The School Grade Disaster (Pygmalion, stereotype threat, self-fulfilling prophecy)
   - 6.4 Compounding Effects (testable prediction, Heckman/Perry Preschool evidence)
   - 6.5 Implications for Educational Practice (4 concrete recommendations)
3. **Final paragraph added** — excluding motivation actively damages society
4. **8 new references** (Rosenthal, Steele, Merton, Heckman, Jaeggi, Melby-Lervag, Chase & Simon, Yeager & Dweck)
5. **README updated** — intelligence paper featured prominently as DRAFT supplemental material
6. **PDF rebuilt** — 22 pages (up from 16), copied to Windows
7. **Testable prediction #6 added** to Discussion (compounding negative effects of motivation-destroying interventions)
8. **New limitation** added about P caveat (broad middle vs extremes)

### Files Modified
- `paper/intelligence/paper.md` — major revision
- `paper/intelligence/paper.tex` — synced with MD
- `paper/intelligence/paper.pdf` — recompiled (22 pages)
- `README.md` — intelligence paper added as DRAFT supplemental
- `session-context.md` — this file

## Next Session TODO
1. **LinkedIn post for intelligence paper** — write a post promoting the intelligence paper draft, similar style to consciousness paper LinkedIn post
2. **Figure for intelligence paper** — create an SVG figure illustrating the recursive K×P×M loop, inspired by the original book diagram style but matching the SVG style used for the consciousness paper figures (figures/figure1-four-model-architecture.svg etc.)
3. Continue book chapter writing (Ch. 2 Brain Anatomy, Ch. 16 Intelligence)
4. arXiv endorsement pursuit
5. Outreach emails (still not sent)

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Intelligence paper PDF is at `paper/intelligence/paper.pdf` and `C:\Users\Matthias\Documents\Intelligence_Paper_DRAFT.pdf`
3. Paper is SUBMITTED to NoC (2026-02-13) — do NOT modify trimmed version
4. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes: `git push origin main && git push private main`
