# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-17 (Session 64)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: PhilSci-Archive rejection handling, outreach email updates, intelligence paper journal submission prep

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 64 wrap-up. Ready for restart.
- **Progress**:
  - PhilSci-Archive REJECTED consciousness paper ("outside range of suitable material") — deleted submission
  - Preprint scorecard: arXiv, bioRxiv, PsyArXiv, PhilSci-Archive ALL rejected consciousness paper. Only Zenodo accepted.
  - Intelligence paper ACCEPTED on PsyArXiv (live at https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg)
  - Updated 3 outreach emails (Priesemann, Metzinger, Carhart-Harris): removed arXiv endorsement asks, added Zenodo DOI
  - Researched *New Ideas in Psychology* submission requirements: 7,500 word limit, APA 7th, .docx, highlights required, free subscription-model submission
  - README updated: PhilSci rejection reflected in all status lines
  - Decision: no additional preprint servers beyond Zenodo (marginal benefit). LinkedIn most effective channel.
  - Decision: submit intelligence paper to *New Ideas in Psychology* (subscription model, free). Paper ~358 words over limit — needs trim.

## TOP TODO (Next Session)
1. **Intelligence paper → *New Ideas in Psychology* submission**: trim ~358 words, write article highlights (3-5 bullets), convert to .docx (APA 7th, double-spaced), submit via Elsevier Editorial Manager
2. Send outreach emails: Priesemann, Metzinger, Carhart-Harris (all updated, ready to send)
3. NoC resubmission: intelligence paper preprint is live on PsyArXiv — can now resubmit
4. DOIs still not added to reference lists (low priority)
5. Implementation project Phase 1 (concept extraction) — `/home/jeltz/aIware.implementation/`

## Key Decisions Made (This Session)
- No additional preprint servers — Zenodo is sufficient, LinkedIn drives engagement
- Intelligence paper → *New Ideas in Psychology* via subscription model (free, preprint stays on PsyArXiv/GitHub)
- $3,420 OA APC rejected — subscription model preserves free access via preprint

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. TOP TODO #1: Intelligence paper submission prep (trim, highlights, .docx, submit)
3. Outreach emails are ready in correspondence/ — just send them with PDF attached
4. All Session 64 work is committed and pushed

## Conversation Summary
Session 64. PhilSci-Archive rejected consciousness paper — 4th preprint rejection. Decided no more preprint hunting (Zenodo is enough, LinkedIn works better). Updated 3 unsent outreach emails: removed arXiv endorsement asks, added Zenodo DOI. Researched *New Ideas in Psychology* requirements (7,500 words, APA 7th, .docx, free submission). Intelligence paper is ~358 words over — needs trim. Tracked as top TODO for next session.
