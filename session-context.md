## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 58 complete
- **Progress**:
  - Rebuilt book .tex + PDF from canonical .md (was 2 sessions behind)
  - Removed ", twice over" at line 242; fixed personal anecdote (knockout, not anesthesia)

  - Full paper .tex regenerated from canonical .md (+1,900 words, 7 bib entries)
  - Updated README: book linked prominently (free manuscript), all stale info fixed

  - All 53 book review items confirmed DONE

## Book Review Items — ALL 53 DONE
All applied across Sessions 55-58.

## Remaining Work
- **Homunculus figure** (Ch.2 placeholder) — user creating
- **Intelligence paper preprint** — post to PsyArXiv (timed with bioRxiv acceptance)
- **Book consistency read-through** (~48,200 words)
- **Book polished edition** — print + ebook planned early summer 2026

## Project State
- **Trimmed paper**: SUBMITTED to NoC 2026-02-13. Under review (~6 weeks).
- **Full paper**: bioRxiv preprint submitted, awaiting acceptance. Journal target: *Physics of Life Reviews* (after NoC decision).
- **Intelligence paper**: draft complete. Preprint → PsyArXiv. Journal target: *New Ideas in Psychology*.
- **Outreach emails**: 2 sent (Hengen + Shriki). Remaining drafts not sent.
- **Book**: ~48,200 words. Free manuscript on GitHub. Print/ebook early summer 2026.

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. One last task pending from user this session — check conversation log
3. Next priorities: PsyArXiv submission, book read-through, outreach

## Conversation Summary
Session 58: Synced all generated files (.tex/.pdf) from canonical .md sources. Wrote C49-51 new Ch.13 subsection on copy problem (sleep interruption, knockout experience, virtual-level transfer, brain's programming language). Corrected stale todo list — all 53 review items already done. Full paper .tex reconciled by background agent (+1,900 words). Determined PsyArXiv best for intelligence paper preprint. Updated README with prominent book link (free manuscript, polished edition early summer). User has one more task.
