# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-16 (Session 59 — COMPLETE)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Handle bioRxiv rejection + NoC formatting issue; get preprints posted; update trimmed paper

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 59 COMPLETE. Ready for restart.
- **Progress**:
  - bioRxiv rejected full paper (scope: not a data paper). Not a merit issue.
  - NoC "unsubmitted" trimmed paper — needs .docx format + highlights file. NOT a rejection.
  - Both papers submitted to PsyArXiv — awaiting moderation (24-72h from 2026-02-16)
  - Trimmed paper updated with ~30 improvements from full paper
  - README cleaned up, conversation log appended, MEMORY.md updated
  - Committed + pushed to both remotes

## Project State
- **Trimmed paper**: Updated with full-paper improvements. Needs .docx conversion + highlights for NoC resubmission.
- **Full paper**: bioRxiv REJECTED (scope). Submitted to PsyArXiv, awaiting moderation.
- **Intelligence paper**: Submitted to PsyArXiv, awaiting moderation.
- **Outreach emails**: 2 sent (Hengen + Shriki). Remaining drafts not sent.
- **Book**: ~48,200 words. Free manuscript on GitHub. Print/ebook early summer 2026.

## AC Implementation Decision (Session 59)
- Separate project folder: `/home/jeltz/aIware.implementation` (sibling to aIware)
- Same GitHub repo — not a new repository
- Architecture design + implementation go there

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Both PsyArXiv submissions pending moderation (24-72h from 2026-02-16)
3. Next priority: Convert trimmed paper to .docx + write highlights file for NoC resubmission
4. Do NOT resubmit to NoC until PsyArXiv preprints are live (add preprint DOIs to submission)

## Conversation Summary
Session 59: Handled two setbacks — bioRxiv rejection (scope, not merit) and NoC unsubmission (formatting). Both papers → PsyArXiv (user submitted both). Systematically updated trimmed paper with ~30 improvements from full paper. Cleaned up README (linked both papers, noted AC implementation folder decision). All committed + pushed.
