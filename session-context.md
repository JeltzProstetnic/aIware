# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 45, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Write Appendix B (intelligence model) for pop-sci book

## What Was Done (Session 45)
- Wrote Appendix B: The Intelligence Model (~2,262 words)
- Replaced placeholder/TODO with full text condensed from paper/intelligence/paper.md
- 10 sections covering: curious omission, three components, recursive loop, operational knowledge, IQ critique, AI test case, consciousness connection, learnability, school grades, external dependency
- Book manuscript now ~32,900 words total

## Canonical File Paths (unchanged from Session 44)
- **Full paper LaTeX**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.tex`
- **Full paper PDF**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.pdf`
- **Full paper Markdown**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`
- **Full paper refs**: `paper/full/biorxiv/references.bib`
- **Trimmed paper (NoC)**: `paper/trimmed/noc/` (FROZEN — submitted 2026-02-13)
- **Intelligence paper**: `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (canonical, 7,400 words, NIP-ready)
- **Intelligence paper LaTeX**: `paper/intelligence/paper.tex` (STALE — needs regeneration from .md)
- **Intelligence paper PDF**: `paper/intelligence/paper.pdf` (STALE — needs regeneration)
- **Book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (~32,900 words)

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### 1. Intelligence paper → LaTeX + NIP submission
- Regenerate `paper/intelligence/paper.tex` from polished .md (the current .tex predates Session 43 edits)
- NIP accepts LaTeX (elsarticle class) — no need for .docx
- Compile PDF
- AI tools declaration for cover letter
- Submit to New Ideas in Psychology

### 2. Computation classes discussion
- 5-class vs 4-class Wolfram
- Scope: book-only or feed back into paper?

### 3. Structural book decisions
- Split Chapter 7 at Clinical Mirror?
- Expand Chapter 8 (split-brain)?
- Two illustrations needed (inside simulation, Game of Life five-class)

### 4. Check bioRxiv upload status

### 5. Book review pass
- ~32,900 words done, needs review for flow/consistency

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Appendix B is DONE — no further work needed
3. Next action: Regenerate intelligence paper.tex from paper.md
4. Intelligence paper at paper/intelligence/paper.md (7,400 words, polished)
5. Intelligence paper.tex is STALE — must be regenerated before submission
