# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-20 (Session 84)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Recovery from rate-limited Session 83 continuation; POD formatting

## What Session 84 Did (So Far)
1. Recovered from rate limit mid-session
2. Copied publishing strategy from Windows Downloads to `tmp/self-publishing-strategy.md`
3. Fixed Appendix A visual processing hierarchy table: replaced single landscape page with two-page spread (verso: Area/Brodmann/RF/Function; recto: Area/Psychedelic signature)
4. Updated `pop-sci/book-manuscript.formatting-rules.md` with spread table rule
5. Updated `tmp/build_book_pdf.py` with `convert_spread_table()` function
6. Rebuilt PDF — 251 pages, US edition

## Current Stats
- Chapters: 16, ~62,331 words
- Pages: 251 (US Trade 6"×9")
- Content: PRINT-READY (text-level)

## Priority: Book → Print-on-Demand (FIRST PRINT)

## Submission Status
- NoC: RESUBMITTED, awaiting feedback
- SSRN: SUBMITTED, awaiting acceptance
- Zenodo cosmology: PUBLISHED (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18698606)
- PsyArXiv intelligence: PUBLISHED (https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kctvg)

## Remaining TODOs (Priority Order)
1. **Cover image hi-res**: User will provide higher-resolution version of cover art later — replace `pop-sci/cover-front.jpg` when received
2. **POD layout review**: User needs to check the two-page spread table in PDF; verify overall layout
3. **Illustrations**: B&W for cost. Current figures (SVG/PNG) need B&W conversion for print
4. **ISBN**: User has ISBNs from Lulu — may need new one. Austrian ISBN agency = ~€70 for 10
5. **Platform**: KDP + IngramSpark + Payhip (strategy at `tmp/self-publishing-strategy.md`)
6. Intelligence paper: trim ~358 words, highlights, .docx, submit to NIdP (deferred)
7. Outreach emails: 3 ready (Priesemann, Metzinger, Carhart-Harris) (deferred)

## Key Files This Session
- `tmp/self-publishing-strategy.md` — publishing strategy (copied from Windows Downloads)
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.formatting-rules.md` — updated with spread table rule
- `tmp/build_book_pdf.py` — updated with `convert_spread_table()`
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.pdf` — rebuilt (251 pages)
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.tex` — regenerated

## Recovery
1. Read this file + MEMORY.md
2. Book: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` — content is print-ready
3. Publishing strategy: `tmp/self-publishing-strategy.md`
4. Next: user review of PDF layout, then cover/ISBN/platform setup
