# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-14 (Session 26, completed)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Evaluate intelligence theory for standalone publication; add author chapter to book

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session complete. Ready for next session.
- **Progress**: Intelligence theory evaluated, publication strategy decided, book outline updated, conversation log updated.
- **Pending**: Intelligence paper drafting, book chapter writing, git commit.

## Session 26 Summary

### Intelligence Theory — Publication Decision
- Read full theory from book (Ch. 3.3.3, pp. 43-55; refined model pp. 242-244)
- Three angles evaluated: (1) formal model paper, (2) theoretical critique paper, (3) AI-focused paper
- **Decision: Angle 2 first (theoretical critique), designed as foundation for Angle 1 (formal model) later**
- Venue candidates: *New Ideas in Psychology*, *Theory & Psychology*
- Key arguments for the paper:
  - Motivation is systematically excluded from intelligence models — this is a genuine blind spot
  - Operational knowledge (Metawissen: learning strategies, logical tools, strategic thinking) is excluded along with factual knowledge, but shouldn't be — it's the multiplier in the recursive loop
  - Intelligence is a recursive, self-reinforcing system (Knowledge + Performance + Motivation), not a static trait
  - AI implication: LLMs have Performance + Knowledge but no Motivation → recursive loop doesn't self-sustain
  - In the AI age, operational knowledge is close to the only thing left worth teaching children

### Author Biography — Key Facts (for book chapter)
- Math passion until ~age 11 (self-taught from father's university math books, no internet, ran out of input)
- Physics ~11-14 (realized field was stuck, math skills insufficient)
- Intelligence/consciousness from ~14 onward
- Four-model theory developed at ~age 25 (~2005-2006), almost a decade before book publication
- Book published 2015, German, 299 pages, zero copies sold

### Terminology Clarifications
- Gf = fluid intelligence (raw problem-solving, peaks ~25, declines) ≈ Performance leg
- Gc = crystalline intelligence (accumulated knowledge, grows throughout life) ≈ Knowledge leg
- Matthew effect = positive feedback loop amplifying initial differences (Stanovich 1986) — exactly what the recursive model predicts
- Operational knowledge = Metawissen = a category of Knowledge (not a separate component), but the most *active* factor long-term

### Files Modified
- `pop-sci/book-outline-expanded.md` — added "About the Author" chapter, updated word counts and chapter dependencies
- `docs/conversation-log.md` — added Sessions 25 and 26
- `session-context.md` — this file

## Key File Locations
- **Full LaTeX**: `paper/full/arxiv/paper.tex`
- **Trimmed LaTeX (SUBMITTED, do NOT modify)**: `paper/trimmed/arxiv/paper.tex`
- **Pop-sci book outline**: `pop-sci/book-outline-expanded.md`
- **Pop-sci manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md`
- **Conversation log**: `docs/conversation-log.md`

## Session 27 TODO (suggested priority)
1. **Intelligence paper (Angle 2)**: Begin drafting theoretical critique for *New Ideas in Psychology*
   - Literature review: Cattell investment theory, Deci & Ryan SDT, Stanovich Matthew effect, Helmar Frank C=S×D, CHC theory, Sternberg triarchic
   - Core argument structure: motivation exclusion + operational knowledge blind spot + recursive loop formalization
2. **Book writing**: Start chapters (About the Author, Ch. 2 Brain Anatomy, Ch. 16 Intelligence — after paper draft)
3. **arXiv endorsement**: Still blocked
4. **Wave 2 outreach**: Emails drafted, NOT SENT
5. **Git commit**: Session 26 changes need committing

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Read `pop-sci/book-outline-expanded.md` for book structure
3. Read `docs/conversation-log.md` Session 26 for full intelligence theory discussion
4. Paper is SUBMITTED to NoC (2026-02-13) — do NOT modify trimmed version
5. Intelligence paper (Angle 2) is DECIDED but NOT STARTED
6. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes: `git push origin main && git push private main`
