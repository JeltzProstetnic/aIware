# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-17 (Session 66)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Write SB-HC4A cosmology paper (Step 1 from Session 65)

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Paper written, formalization saved separately
- **Progress**:
  - Read all source materials (Session 65 conversation, FMT formalization, full paper, website content, book manuscript appendices)
  - Wrote full cosmology paper: `paper/cosmology/sb-hc4a.md` (~7,000 words)
  - Saved formalization notes: `paper/cosmology/SB-HC4A_formal.md`
  - Paper follows same academic style as existing papers
  - All 5 weak points included (including cognitive ceiling)
  - Bruno Gruber acknowledged in Section 1.3
  - 12 sections: Introduction, Five-Class Framework, Universe Must Be Class 4, Quasi-Infinity, Singularities as Information Boundaries, Holographic Class 4 Architecture, Consciousness-Cosmology Symmetry, Energy/Information/Conservation, Where This Could Break (5 weak points), Necessity Argument, Discussion, Conclusion
  - ~55 references

## TOP TODO (Next Session)
1. **Review the paper** — user should read and provide feedback
2. **Step 2**: Develop formal specification further (SB-HC4A_formal.md has open questions and TODOs)
3. **Step 3**: Pop-sci book chapter laying out the cosmological model for general audience
4. Intelligence paper: trim ~358 words, highlights, .docx, submit to *New Ideas in Psychology*
5. NoC resubmission (trimmed paper .docx ready)
6. Outreach emails (3 ready to send)

## Key Files This Session
- `paper/cosmology/sb-hc4a.md` — the cosmology paper (CANONICAL SOURCE)
- `paper/cosmology/SB-HC4A_formal.md` — formalization working notes
- `tmp/cosmological-model-conversation-session65.md` — source conversation

## Recovery Instructions
1. The cosmology paper is complete as a first draft at `paper/cosmology/sb-hc4a.md`
2. Formalization notes saved at `paper/cosmology/SB-HC4A_formal.md`
3. User needs to review the paper before further work
4. The paper follows .md = canonical source rule (no .tex generated yet)

## Conversation Summary
Session 66. Wrote the SB-HC4A cosmology paper (Step 1 from Session 65 TODO). Full academic paper derived from the Session 65 conversation, following the style of existing papers. Formalization attempt saved separately in SB-HC4A_formal.md as requested.
