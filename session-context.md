# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-13 (Session 11, end)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Scientific paper + pop-sci content — DONE

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session closing
- **Progress**: Paper written, fixed (including ConCrit attribution), pushed. Pop-sci content created. All tasks complete.
- **Next**: Frontiers submission prep, magazine submissions, arXiv, LinkedIn post

## Files Created/Modified This Session
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `paper.md` | Pushed | ~19k words, 11 sections, ~95 references. All fixes applied including ConCrit separation |
| `paper-outline.md` | Pushed | Structural outline |
| `README.md` | Pushed | Rewritten to feature the paper |
| `theory.md` | Modified | ConCrit attribution fixed |
| `pop-sci/video-script.md` | Pushed | 12-min direct-to-camera |
| `pop-sci/podcast-script.md` | Pushed | 40-min interview format |
| `pop-sci/linkedin-post.md` | Pushed | Announcement post |
| `pop-sci/magazine-article.md` | **LOCAL ONLY** (gitignored) | ~2,500 words |
| `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` | **LOCAL ONLY** (gitignored) | ~15,000 words, 12 chapters |

## ConCrit Attribution — CORRECTED
Two separate papers, previously conflated:
1. **ConCrit Framework**: Inbal Algom & Oren Shriki (2026). *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews*, 180, 106483. — Theoretical framework linking criticality to consciousness theories.
2. **140-Dataset Meta-Analysis**: Keith B. Hengen & Woodrow L. Shew (2025). *Neuron*, 113(16), 2582-2598. — Empirical meta-analysis confirming criticality across brain states.

## Open TODOs (Complete List)

### Paper — Frontiers Submission Prep
- [ ] Trim paper from ~19k to 12k words (Frontiers "Hypothesis and Theory" limit)
- [ ] Create 2×2 model architecture figure (essential)
- [ ] Add experimental protocol sketches to §8 predictions
- [ ] Format for Frontiers LaTeX/Word template
- [ ] Write cover letter for Frontiers submission
- [ ] Submit to Frontiers

### Paper — arXiv
- [ ] Self-review the paper (wait a few days for fresh eyes)
- [ ] Check arXiv endorsement requirements for q-bio.NC category
- [ ] Post to arXiv

### Pop-Sci — Magazine Article
- [ ] Self-review magazine article
- [ ] Identify target magazines (Scientific American, New Scientist, Nautilus, Aeon, etc.)
- [ ] Research submission guidelines per target
- [ ] Submit to first-choice magazine
- [ ] **STORE PRIVATELY** (not on public GitHub — first-publication rights)

### Pop-Sci — Book
- [ ] Self-review book manuscript
- [ ] Decide: traditional publisher vs self-publish
- [ ] If traditional: write book proposal, query agents
- [ ] If self-publish: formatting, cover, distribution
- [ ] **STORE PRIVATELY** (not on public GitHub)

### Pop-Sci — Video
- [ ] Record video using `pop-sci/video-script.md`
- [ ] Create graphics (2×2 grid, timeline, molecular structure, etc.)
- [ ] Edit and upload

### Pop-Sci — Podcast
- [ ] Identify target podcast hosts to approach
- [ ] Pitch using the theory's hooks
- [ ] Adapt `pop-sci/podcast-script.md` per host format

### Visibility — LinkedIn
- [ ] Post `pop-sci/linkedin-post.md` (Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am)
- [ ] Create/attach 2×2 model diagram image
- [ ] Tag relevant contacts in first comment

### Private Storage (magazine + book)
- [ ] Set up private GitHub repo OR use private visibility (see proposal below)

### Conversation Log
- [ ] Append Session 11 summary to conversation-log.md (next session)

## Private Storage Proposal
**Recommended: Create a separate private GitHub repo** (`aIware-private` or `aIware-manuscripts`).

Options considered:
| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Private repo** (recommended) | Clean separation, can share selectively with editors/agents, free for personal accounts | Two repos to manage |
| Private branch on public repo | Everything in one repo | Git branches are NOT access-controlled — anyone with repo access sees all branches. NOT truly private. |
| GitHub Gist (secret) | Quick, no repo setup | No version control, awkward for multiple files |

**Action**: Create `JeltzProstetnic/aIware-private` (private), push magazine article + book manuscript there.

## Roadmap (updated)
1. ~~Theory extraction~~ DONE
2. ~~Challenge round (10/10)~~ DONE
3. ~~Documentation consolidation~~ DONE
4. ~~Scientific paper~~ DONE (first draft, pushed)
5. **Visibility & outreach** — IN PROGRESS
6. ~~Pop-sci magazine article~~ DRAFT DONE (local only)
7. ~~Accessible book~~ DRAFT DONE (local only)
8. AC architecture design — Upcoming
9. AC implementation — Upcoming

## Recovery Instructions
If session terminates and restarts:
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Paper, README, public pop-sci scripts are all pushed to GitHub
3. Magazine article at `pop-sci/magazine-article.md` and book at `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` are LOCAL ONLY (gitignored)
4. **PRIORITY**: Set up private repo for manuscripts, then Frontiers submission prep
5. ConCrit attribution has been corrected (two papers, not one)
