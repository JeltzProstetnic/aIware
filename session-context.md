## What Was Done This Session
1. **NIdP desk rejection received** — NEWIDEAS-D-26-00184, editor Francesca Ervas, <24h turnaround, no peer review. Transfer offered to Acta Psychologica / Methods in Psychology.
2. **Journal comparison** — researched 5 alternative journals: Acta Psychologica (IF 2.7, $2,600 APC), Frontiers in Psychology (IF 3.27, $2,950 APC, reputation concerns), Adaptive Behavior (IF 1.3, free, niche), Philosophical Psychology (IF 2.1, free, best scope fit). Methods in Psychology eliminated (methodology journal, wrong scope).
3. **Decision: Philosophical Psychology** — best scope match for philosophical argument about intelligence, FMT grounding is asset not liability, zero cost (subscription model).
4. **Elsevier transfer declined** by user.
5. **Manuscript prepared** — anonymized version (self-citations → [Author], Acknowledgments → Disclosure Statement) and full version with author details. Trimmed abstract 228→184 words. Added AI disclosure (Claude Opus 4, editorial assistance and formatting).
6. **Submitted to Philosophical Psychology** via ScholarOne (mc.manuscriptcentral.com/cphp). Two files: Manuscript Anonymous + Manuscript with Author Details. Cover letter, all metadata filled.
7. **Source .md updated** — target journal, status, acknowledgments section added.
