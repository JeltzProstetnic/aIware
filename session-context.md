# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 32, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Execute German book content integration + publication strategy

## Current State
- **Active Task**: None — session complete
- **Progress**: All integration done, journal strategy researched, paper connections analyzed
- **Pending**: Review manuscript flow, start intelligence paper, preprint posting

## Session 32 — What Happened

### German Book Content Integration — COMPLETE
Executed the full integration plan from Session 31b. 10 parallel agents + 1 manual insertion.

**Book manuscript** (`pop-sci/book-manuscript.md`): 768 → 1,070 lines, ~22,500 → ~26,500 words
**Full paper** (`paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`): ~12,600 → ~14,400 body words (+1,800)
Total: ~5,800 new words across both documents. All H1-H8 and M1-M7 items integrated.

### Journal Strategy for Long Paper — RESEARCHED
Analysis: `tmp/paper-connections-analysis.md` + journal research in conversation log.

**Immediate**: Post full paper to PsyArXiv + bioRxiv (no endorsement wall, establishes priority)
**After NoC decision**:
- If accepted → extended version as companion paper at NoC, or submit to *Physics of Life Reviews* (IF ~11-13)
- If rejected → submit full version to *Physics of Life Reviews* → *Consciousness & Cognition* → *JCS*
**Do NOT submit to any journal while NoC review is active.**

### Intelligence-Consciousness Paper Connections — ANALYZED
Analysis at `tmp/paper-connections-analysis.md`. Key findings:
- Causal chain: `four-model architecture → consciousness → cognitive learning → recursive intelligence`
- Each paper covers one half. Consciousness paper: mechanism. Intelligence paper: implication.
- Mushroom example: cite in intelligence paper, don't reproduce (self-plagiarism risk)
- 4 cross-reference points identified in each direction
- Two papers in two subfield journals strengthens credibility
- Write intelligence paper now during NoC review

## Open Tasks for Next Session
1. **Review manuscript flow/consistency** — full read-through of book-manuscript.md (Task #12 tracked)
2. **Start intelligence paper** for *New Ideas in Psychology*
3. **Post to PsyArXiv/bioRxiv** — full paper preprint
4. Ongoing: arXiv endorsement, outreach emails, LinkedIn, book Ch. 2 anatomy

## Key File Locations
- **Pop-sci book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (26,500 words)
- **Full paper**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (14,400 body words)
- **Trimmed LaTeX (SUBMITTED, do NOT modify)**: `paper/trimmed/arxiv/paper.tex`
- **Paper connections analysis**: `tmp/paper-connections-analysis.md`
- **Comparison report**: `tmp/comparison-report.md`

## Recovery Instructions
1. Session 32 is DONE — integration complete, strategy researched
2. Next: review manuscript flow (Task #12), then start intelligence paper
3. Consider PsyArXiv/bioRxiv posting of full paper
4. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes
