# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 35, in progress)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: LaTeX/PDF sync + intelligence paper refinement

## Current State
- **Active Task**: None — session complete
- **Progress**: All tasks complete (LaTeX sync, intelligence refinement, cross-check, README, conversation log)
- **Pending**: Nothing

## Session 35 — What Happened

### Task 1: LaTeX/PDF Sync — COMPLETE
- Added 2 cross-references to `Gruber (forthcoming)` in `paper/full/arxiv/paper.tex`:
  1. Section 10.1 (Implications for AI): sentence about intelligence implications of architectural specification
  2. Conclusion: sentence about theory's implications extending beyond consciousness science
- Added `@unpublished{GruberForthcoming}` to `paper/full/arxiv/references.bib`
- Recompiled PDF (51 pages, all refs resolved)
- **Note**: 3rd cross-ref from Markdown (cognitive learning section) cannot be added — that section doesn't exist in LaTeX yet. The LaTeX is substantially shorter than the Markdown full paper.

### Task 2: Intelligence Paper Refinement — COMPLETE
9 insertions executed per the refinement plan:

**Tier 1 (critical):**
1. Section 2.1: Added Canivez & Youngstrom (2019) on CHC internal limitations
2. Section 3.3: Added Bratsberg & Rogeberg (2018) Flynn effect reversal
3. Section 3.3: Added Gignac & Zajenkowski (2024) Austrian paradox
4. Section 6.1: Added Macnamara & Burgoyne (2023) growth mindset critique — reframed as evidence for recursive model

**Tier 2 (positioning):**
5. Section 3.4: Added van Geert (2020) process ontology
6. Section 3.4: Added Balboni et al. (2021) adaptive intelligence
7. Section 3.4: Added Sternberg et al. (2021) meta-intelligence

**Tier 3 (strengthening):**
8. Section 7.1: Added Hilger et al. (2020) neural dynamics
9. Section 5: Added reasoning-model era update (o1/o3)
10. Section 2.6: Added Carr & Dweck (2019) pattern exemplar

**References:**
- Added 10 new references to main References section
- Integrated 4 "Additional References" (Ackerman, Duckworth 2007, Snow, Stanovich 2016) into main section
- Removed 2 uncited entries (Bergold 2024, Mussel 2013)
- Eliminated "Additional References" section entirely
- **Correction**: Refinement plan had "Duckworth & Datu (2019)" — actual authors are Carr & Dweck (2019). Fixed.
- **Correction**: Sternberg (2021) is actually Sternberg et al. (2021) with 6 authors. Fixed.

**Word count**: 7,858 → 9,139 words (+1,281). Under 10K limit with ~861 words buffer.
**Citation audit**: All citations have matching references. All references are cited. Clean.

## Open Tasks for Next Session
1. **Remaining manuscript fixes** — 1 critical (five-hierarchy promise) + 7 important from flow review (`tmp/manuscript-flow-review.md`)
2. **bioRxiv submission** — follow guide in `tmp/preprint-submission-guide.md`
3. **Full LaTeX parity** — LaTeX `paper.tex` is missing substantial Markdown content (cognitive learning section, Libet reinterpretation, etc.)
4. Ongoing: arXiv endorsement, outreach emails, NoC review wait (~6 weeks from Feb 13)

## Key File Locations
- **Full paper LaTeX (UPDATED)**: `paper/full/arxiv/paper.tex` (+ PDF recompiled)
- **Intelligence paper (UPDATED)**: `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (9,139 words, 9 insertions + 10 new refs)
- **Trimmed LaTeX (SUBMITTED, do NOT modify)**: `paper/trimmed/arxiv/paper.tex`
- **Pop-sci book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md`

### Cross-Check Fixes Applied
- Intelligence paper: corrected consciousness paper title in references
- Intelligence paper: added Gruber (2015) book citation (was missing entirely)
- Intelligence paper: fixed cognitive learning attribution to cite book + submitted paper

### Cleanup
- README updated (intelligence paper description, roadmap, file link)
- Conversation log appended (Session 35 entry)
- All README links verified — all files exist

## Recovery Instructions
1. Session 35 is DONE — all tasks complete, committed and pushed
2. Next: manuscript fixes from flow review, then bioRxiv submission
