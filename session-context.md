# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 32c, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Execute German book content integration + publication strategy + cross-references

## Current State
- **Active Task**: None — session complete
- **Progress**: All integration done, cross-references added, README updated, journal strategy researched
- **Pending**: PsyArXiv/bioRxiv preprint posting, manuscript flow review, intelligence paper refinement

## Session 32c — What Happened (continuation)

### Cross-References Between Papers — COMPLETE
Added bidirectional cross-references between consciousness and intelligence papers:
- **Intelligence paper** (`paper/intelligence/paper.md`): 4 in-text citations of "Gruber, submitted" + 1 reference entry
- **Consciousness paper** (`paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`): 3 in-text citations of "Gruber, forthcoming" + 1 reference entry
- Mushroom example: confirmed NOT reproduced in intelligence paper (only cited)

### README Bridge Concept — ADDED
Added bridge section to `README.md` showing the causal chain:
```
Four-Model Architecture → Consciousness → Cognitive Learning → Recursive Intelligence
         ╰──── Paper 1 (mechanism) ────╯   ╰──── Paper 2 (implication) ────╯
```

## Recovery Instructions
1. Session 32c is DONE — cross-references added, README updated, committed + pushed
2. FIRST TASK next session: Guide PsyArXiv/bioRxiv preprint submission (user explicitly requested this)
3. Then: review manuscript flow (Task #12)
4. Intelligence paper already exists as complete draft — refine, don't rewrite
5. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes
