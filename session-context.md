- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Overleaf upload, arXiv submission, outreach execution

  - README updated (PDF links, CC BY 4.0 license)
  - 5 outreach emails drafted as `.txt` files — NONE SENT YET
  - Email addresses corrected: Shriki (`shrikio@bgu.ac.il`), Hengen (`khengen@wustl.edu`)

## Next Session Priority
1. **Polish pop-sci articles** — user requested this explicitly
   - `pop-sci/magazine-article.md` (gitignored, local only)
   - `pop-sci/video-script.md`
   - `pop-sci/podcast-script.md`
   - `pop-sci/linkedin-post.md`
   - `pop-sci/magazine-article.html`
   - Link polished versions prominently in README
2. **Resend Shriki + Hengen** with corrected addresses (+ attach PDF)
3. **Send Metzinger, Carhart-Harris, Priesemann** (+ attach PDF)
4. **Draft ASSC 29 abstract** (satellite deadline **Feb 28**)

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Pop-sci polish is the immediate task — read the files in `pop-sci/` to assess what needs work
3. Emails are in individual `.txt` files in project root — all need sending
4. arXiv is paused at endorsement — resumes once any endorser clicks the link
5. Paper has 9 predictions, P1=fMRI. PDF is the canonical reading version.
6. `networking-plan.md` has full contact strategy
7. `outreach-emails.md` has all templates (addresses corrected)
