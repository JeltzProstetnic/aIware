# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-17 (Session 68, pre-shutdown)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Write cosmology book chapters + update all papers — DONE

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Ready for restart
- **Progress**:
  - Two cosmology chapters (15 + 16) written and integrated into book manuscript
  - Both cosmology papers updated (cyclic cosmology, CPT, Big Rip, computational atoms)
  - Book subtitle updated: "The Architecture of Consciousness, Computation, and the Cosmos"
  - README updated, PDFs regenerated
  - All committed and pushed

## DECISIONS MADE THIS SESSION
1. **Book subtitle changed** to "The Architecture of Consciousness, Computation, and the Cosmos"
2. **Big Bang is asymptotically unreachable** — not a finite time in the past (information boundary like event horizon)
3. **Heat death is a singularity** → triggers cyclic restart via Bekenstein saturation
4. **Big Bang/Crunch may alternate** with possible CPT signature flip (matter/antimatter universes)
5. **Big Rip** as third endgame: fractal explosion of singularities, potential multiverse generator
6. **Particles as computational atoms**: finite types from finite stable configurations, interactions as computation, conservation laws as information conservation, three generations possibly from Class 4 self-similarity

## TOP TODO (Next Session)
1. Intelligence paper: trim ~358 words, write highlights, generate .docx, submit to *New Ideas in Psychology*
2. NoC resubmission (trimmed paper .docx ready)
3. Outreach emails (3 ready to send)
4. Review cosmology chapters for flow/consistency (author review pass)
5. Consider whether computational atoms insight warrants a separate short paper

## Key Files Modified This Session
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` — +2 chapters, new subtitle, TOC, Coda, Ch5/Ch14 bridges
- `paper/cosmology/sb-hc4a.md` — cyclic cosmology, asymptotic unreachability, CPT, Big Rip, computational atoms
- `paper/cosmology_formal/sb-hc4a-formalization.md` — same as above in formal mathematical style
- `README.md` — updated for new content

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read session-context.md (this file) for current state
2. Top priority: intelligence paper submission prep
3. CANONICAL SOURCE RULE: .md is always canonical, .tex/.pdf are generated
