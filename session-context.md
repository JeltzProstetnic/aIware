## Conversation Summary
Session 56: Resolved 8 of 12 postponed C items from the book review. Key additions: digital twin analogy in Ch.2, 't Hooft speculative connection in Ch.5, split-brain author position in Ch.9, salvia rewrite with external time-dilation account in Ch.6, Crick/Koch reference, lucid dreaming appendix. Reframed the LLM loop prompt (C47) from a failed consciousness test into a teaching moment about why behavioral tests fundamentally cannot solve the other-minds problem. Author decided C49-51 will be combined into a single new Ch.13 subsection (deferred). Author re-checking Ch.2 digital twin intro.
