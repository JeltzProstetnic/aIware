# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-13 (Session 10)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Documentation consolidation (in progress)

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Documentation consolidation — terminology rename done, theory.md created, session-context.md cleanup in progress
- **Progress**: Challenge round complete (10/10). Doc consolidation in progress.
- **Pending**: Finish consolidation → scientific paper → visibility strategy → pop-sci article → accessible book → AC architecture → AC implementation

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `theory.md` | **Complete theory** — standalone, paper-ready. Read this for the theory. |
| `conversation-log.md` | **Full transcript** — verbatim record of all sessions, for posterity |
| `session-context.md` | **This file** — working state, roadmap, recovery instructions |
| `references.md` | ~200 literature references with URLs, organized by category |
| `README.md` | Public-facing project summary |
| `figures/` | Key diagrams from the book (pages 64, 65, 262, 264) |
| Book PDF (gitignored) | `/home/jeltz/aIware/Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins 6x9 lit.pdf` (299pp, German) |
| Also on Windows | `/mnt/c/Users/Matthias/Documents/_Eigene/Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins 6x9 lit.pdf` |

## Terminology

English terms adopted in Session 10 (replacing German originals from the book):

| English | Abbreviation | German original |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Implicit World Model | IWM | Metamodell |
| Implicit Self Model | ISM | Selbstmodell |
| Explicit World Model | EWM | Weltmodell |
| Explicit Self Model | ESM | Ich-Modell |

Conversation log preserves original German terms in historical sessions 1-9.

## Challenge Round — Complete (10/10)

| # | Challenge | Status | Session |
|---|-----------|--------|---------|
| I | Simulation Subject Problem | CLOSED | 3 |
| II | Ontological Status | CLOSED | 4 |
| III | Passive Experience | CLOSED | 5 |
| IV | Binding Mechanism | CLOSED | 6 |
| V | Dreams | CLOSED | 7 |
| VI | Psychedelics | CLOSED | 8 |
| VII | Anesthesia & Disorders | CLOSED | 9 |
| VIII | Split-Brain | CLOSED | 9 |
| IX | Predictions | CLOSED | 10 |
| X | Animal Consciousness | CLOSED | 9 |

**Score: 8/8 strong** on the 8 requirements. See `theory.md` for full details.

## Project Roadmap (revised Session 10)

1. **Documentation consolidation** — IN PROGRESS. Terminology renamed. theory.md created. Session-context slimmed.
2. **Scientific paper** — Formal academic paper targeting consciousness researchers.
   - Address state of the art (IIT, GWT, HOT, PP, AST, SMT, etc.)
   - Map to the 8 open problems/requirements
   - Show how Gruber's theory handles each better than competitors
   - Include the 8 novel predictions (Challenge IX)
   - Formal structure: abstract, introduction, review, theory, comparison, predictions, conclusion
   - Tone: rigorous, citation-heavy, journal-ready
3. **Visibility strategy** — Target journals, conferences, researchers, media. Outreach plan.
4. **Pop-sci magazine article** — Short, punchy, submittable to popular science magazines.
5. **Accessible book** — Shorter, readable rewrite of the 299pp German original.
6. **AC architecture design** — Blueprint from theory's functional requirements.
7. **AC implementation** — Build it. Let people feel the difference.

**Context**: The book ("Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins", 299pp, German) has sold ZERO copies. Self-described as hard to read. Publications needed for credibility (paper) and reach (pop-sci).

## Conversation Summary

- **Session 1**: 6 parallel research tracks covering full consciousness landscape. User gave OVERRIDE hypothesis.
- **Session 2**: Book PDF analysis. Theory extracted. Scored 5 strong / 2 partial / 1 moderate. User answered 3 challenges (virtual qualia, dissolution, substrate independence). Roadmap set.
- **Session 3**: Challenge I (Simulation Subject) CLOSED. Virtual qualia + functional identity + zombie reductio.
- **Session 4**: Challenge II (Ontological Status) CLOSED. Process physicalism, epiphenomenalism, weak emergence, continuum.
- **Session 5**: Challenge III (Passive Experience) CLOSED. Rest state of mechanism. Epiphenomenalism preserved.
- **Session 6**: Challenge IV (Binding) CLOSED. Critical dynamics. Independent convergence with ConCrit.
- **Session 7**: Challenge V (Dreams) CLOSED. Criticality threshold unification. Lucid dreaming = virtuality evidence.
- **Session 8**: Challenge VI (Psychedelics) CLOSED. Redirectable ESM. Salvia evidence. Implicit→explicit permeability.
- **Session 9**: Challenges VII, VIII, X CLOSED. Anesthesia/disorders derived. DID = model forking. Split-brain = holographic cloning. Animal consciousness = gradient.
- **Session 10**: Challenge IX (Predictions) CLOSED by Claude, accepted by user. 8 predictions. Roadmap revised. Documentation consolidation begun. Theory.md created. Terminology renamed.

## Open Issues

### Are ALL Four Models Virtual?
The theory presents a real/virtual split: implicit models as "real side," explicit models as "virtual side." But the author stated (Session 7) that all four might be virtual. If so, what is the "real side"? Raw neural substrate with no model-level description? Track as open research question for the paper. Not a weakness — a frontier.

### Paper Concerns
- **Epiphenomenalism will face pushback** — needs a strong defense section
- **Holographic binding** — standard NN property, but formalize using established terminology (distributed representations, graceful degradation, attractor dynamics)

### TODOs
- [ ] Read matthiasgruber.com before writing the paper
- [ ] Update README repository contents section (add theory.md)

## Recovery Instructions
If session terminates and restarts:
1. Read THIS FILE for working state
2. Read `theory.md` for the complete theory
3. ALL 10 CHALLENGES ARE CLOSED. Challenge round is complete.
4. Check roadmap above for current phase
5. `conversation-log.md` has full transcript of all sessions
6. `references.md` has ~200 curated references for the paper
