# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-13 (Session 17, ready for restart)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Paper trimming for NoC + outreach emails / arXiv endorsement

## Current State
- **Pop-sci polish**: ALL DONE (magazine, video, podcast, book manuscript, LinkedIn)
- **Git**: Both repos in sync (origin + private), all polished content pushed
- **Journal target**: Neuroscience of Consciousness (confirmed by user)
  - Submit as **Review Article** (10,000 word limit)
  - Body text is currently 12,160 words → trim ~2,200 words
  - APC = Article Processing Charge: €2,144 (the fee to publish open-access)
- **arXiv**: Paused at endorsement wall (link: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=E9JU9T)

## Next Session — Two Parallel Workstreams

### Workstream 1: Paper Trimming
- Trim body from 12,160 to ~10,000 words for NoC Review Article format
- Candidates for trimming: lengthy literature review passages, redundant cross-references between sections
- CONSTRAINT: User says paper is already very condensed — don't lose substance
- Draft new cover letter for Neuroscience of Consciousness (current one targets Frontiers)
- Get ORCID, consider joining ASSC for APC discount

### Workstream 2: Outreach Emails = arXiv Endorsement Chase
- 5 emails drafted, NONE sent yet:
  - `email-shriki.txt` → shrikio@bgu.ac.il (ConCrit author, most aligned)
  - `email-hengen.txt` → khengen@wustl.edu (140-dataset meta-analysis)
  - `email-metzinger.txt` → metzinger@uni-mainz.de (Self-Model Theory)
  - `email-carhart-harris.txt` → robin.carhart-harris@ucsf.edu (Entropic Brain)
  - `email-priesemann.txt` → viola.priesemann@ds.mpg.de (criticality expert)
- Any of these researchers could provide arXiv endorsement
- Outreach also builds credibility for cover letter ("discussed with Dr. X")

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Start both workstreams in parallel
3. For paper trimming: read `paper.md`, identify passages to condense
4. For outreach: review email files in project root, send them
5. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes: `git push origin main && git push private main`
