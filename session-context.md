# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 47, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: bioRxiv submission support + book structural edits + next steps prep

## What Was Done (Session 47)
- Prepared bioRxiv submission info (title, abstract, keywords, declarations, AI tools statement)
- bioRxiv submission IN PROGRESS by user at submit.biorxiv.org
- **Split Chapter 7** at "The Clinical Mirror" → new Chapter 8
  - Chapter 7 now: sleep, dreams, lucid dreaming, anesthesia, consciousness map table
  - Chapter 8 now: blindsight, Anton's, covert awareness, Cotard's, alien hand, Charles Bonnet, deja vu, therapy, conversion disorder
  - All 19+ cross-references updated (Chapters 8-12 → 9-13)
  - Notes and References split into separate Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 entries
  - ToC updated with all 13 chapters
- **Expanded Chapter 9** (split-brain, formerly Chapter 8) from ~900 to ~2,100 words
  - Added: interhemispheric conflict examples (buttoning/unbuttoning, hand-grabbing)
  - Added: Nagel (1971) and Parfit on "one person or two?"
  - Added: Pinto et al. (2017) reexamination + holographic explanation
  - Added: Lashley's distributed memory experiments
  - Added: DID and childhood trauma — developmental window for forking
  - Added: Reinders follow-up studies (DID neural differences > simulated DID)
  - Updated Notes with new references
- Fixed forward reference in Chapter 6 (salvia time dilation → Chapter 13, not Chapter 9)
- Prepared NIP cover letter draft for intelligence paper
- Prepared book work plan for next sessions

## Book word count: 34,013 (was 32,869)

## Canonical File Paths
- **Full paper LaTeX**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.tex` (CANONICAL for full paper)
- **Full paper PDF**: `paper/full/biorxiv/paper.pdf` (54pp)
- **Full paper Markdown**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (synced with LaTeX)
- **Full paper refs**: `paper/full/biorxiv/references.bib`
- **Trimmed paper (NoC)**: `paper/trimmed/noc/` (FROZEN — submitted 2026-02-13)
- **Intelligence paper**: `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (canonical, ~8,757 words)
- **Intelligence paper LaTeX**: `paper/intelligence/paper.tex` (CURRENT, 25pp)
- **Intelligence paper PDF**: `paper/intelligence/paper.pdf` (CURRENT)
- **Book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (~34,000 words, 13 chapters)

## Next Steps (for Session 48)

### 1. Book: Computation classes (5-class vs 4-class Wolfram)
- Chapter 5 discusses Wolfram's 4-class system
- The 5-class idea appears in the holographic principle section (Chapter 5, ~line 562)
- Decision needed: book-only speculation or feed back into paper?
- Two illustrations needed: inside simulation, Game of Life five-class

### 2. Book: Review pass
- Flow and consistency check across all 34,000 words
- Verify cross-references between all 13 chapters
- Check Appendix B cross-references to companion intelligence paper
- Ensure About the Author intelligence loop matches Appendix B model
- Check for tone shifts between sessions
- Final proofread

### 3. Intelligence paper → NIP submission
- LaTeX and PDF current
- Cover letter draft prepared (in conversation)
- Submit after bioRxiv preprint is posted (so cover letter can reference DOI)

### 4. Confirm bioRxiv upload
- User submitting full paper during this session

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Check if bioRxiv submission was completed — ask user for DOI
3. Next book task: computation classes discussion (item 3 from Session 46 plan)
4. Intelligence paper needs NIP cover letter finalized then submission
5. All commits should be pushed to both remotes
