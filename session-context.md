# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-13 (Session 13, in progress)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Consolidation audit — align all documentation with paper.md after prediction reorder

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Consolidation audit COMPLETE
- **Progress**:
  - Prediction reorder (P1=fMRI, all others +1): DONE in paper.md (Session 12)
  - Figure fixes (figure1-v2.svg, figure2-v2.svg created): DONE (Session 12)
  - Consolidation audit across all docs: DONE (Session 13)
- **Next**: Frontiers LaTeX/Word formatting, arXiv, magazine submissions

## What Changed This Session
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `theory.md` | Updated prediction table: 8→9 predictions, added P1 (fMRI), renumbered all others |
| `paper-outline.md` | Fixed "2x2 architecture"→"two orthogonal axes", updated prediction count 8→9, renumbered predictions, fixed section references (P2/P3→P3/P4) |
| `cover-letter.md` | Fixed prediction references: Prediction 2→3 (ego dissolution), Prediction 3→4 (anosognosia) |
| `README.md` | Updated prediction count: "eight"→"nine" in two places |
| `pop-sci/magazine-article.md` | Fixed "2x2 grid"→"two axes", updated prediction count 8→9 |
| `pop-sci/linkedin-post.md` | Updated prediction count 8→9, fixed "2x2 model diagram"→"four-model architecture diagram" |
| `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` | Fixed "2x2 grid"→"two orthogonal dimensions", updated chapter title/count to 9, added P1 (fMRI) and renumbered all predictions, updated end-of-book summary and notes |
| `pop-sci/podcast-script.md` | Updated prediction count 8→9 |
| `pop-sci/video-script.md` | Fixed "2x2 grid" graphics notes→"four-model architecture (two orthogonal axes)", updated prediction count 8→9 |
| `session-context.md` | Updated to Session 13 |

## Remote Config
- `origin` → `JeltzProstetnic/aIware` (public) — ONLY push target
- `aIware-private` exists on GitHub (private) — manuscripts in `manuscripts/` dir, pushed via API (no local remote configured — dual-push architecture was broken)

## Open TODOs

### Immediate
- [ ] Format paper for Frontiers LaTeX/Word template
- [ ] Check word count after Prediction 1 (fMRI) addition (may need minor trim)
- [ ] Render SVGs to PDF/PNG for journal submission

### Near-term
- [ ] arXiv posting (check q-bio.NC endorsement requirements)
- [ ] Self-review paper with fresh eyes
- [ ] Magazine submissions
- [ ] LinkedIn post

### Ongoing
- [ ] Book manuscript review
- [ ] Video recording
- [ ] Podcast outreach

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Everything is committed and pushed through Session 12
3. Session 13 changes (consolidation audit) are LOCAL ONLY — not yet committed
4. Paper is ready for Frontiers formatting (~12k body words, 9 predictions, 3 figures)
5. Cover letter at `cover-letter.md` targets Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience
6. Private repo manuscripts accessible via GitHub API only (no local backup remote)
7. All documentation files now consistent with paper.md prediction numbering (P1=fMRI through P9=DID)
