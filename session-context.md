# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-13 (Session 17, context continuation)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Pop-sci publication-ready polish + journal submission progress

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Pop-sci editorial polish COMPLETE; journal decision pending user input
- **Progress**:
  - ASSC 29: dropped (user can't travel, no urgency)
  - Magazine article (.md + .html): DONE — major rewrite targeting Aeon
  - Video script: DONE — jargon removal, stronger ending
  - Podcast script: DONE — minimal (already strong, just proprioception fix)
  - Book manuscript: DONE — targeted polish, consistent jargon treatment
  - LinkedIn post: DONE — minor fix
  - Mechanical fixes across all pieces: prediction numbering, ConCrit attribution/dating
  - Journal research: DONE — recommending Neuroscience of Consciousness over Frontiers
  - Editorial analysis: DONE — Aeon as primary magazine target
- **Pending**:
  - User confirmation on journal switch (NoC vs Frontiers)
  - Paper trimming (12k → 9k words) for NoC if chosen
  - New cover letter for chosen journal
  - arXiv endorsement still needed
  - All 5 outreach emails still NOT SENT
  - README update to link polished pop-sci
  - Aeon query once arXiv is live

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. All pop-sci pieces are now publication-ready
3. Next decision: confirm journal target (Neuroscience of Consciousness recommended)
4. If NoC confirmed: trim paper from 12k to 9k words, draft new cover letter
5. Complete arXiv submission (endorsement link: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=E9JU9T)
6. Send outreach emails (files in project root as `.txt`)
7. Query Aeon (editor@aeon.co) once arXiv live

## Conversation Summary
User asked for level 3 (publication-ready) polish on all pop-sci pieces plus parallel journal submission progress. ASSC 29 dropped. All pop-sci pieces now polished. Journal research recommends switching from Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience (IF 2.48, Q3) to Neuroscience of Consciousness (IF 4.3, Q1, 6-week review, ASSC official journal). User hasn't yet confirmed the journal switch.
