# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-13 (Session 15)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Author review revisions, publication/networking continuation

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Paper revisions complete (Session 15), ready for commit + continued publication work
- **Progress**:
  - 6 author-review revisions applied to both `paper.md` and `arxiv/paper.tex`
  - Added `Treisman1980` BibTeX entry to `arxiv/references.bib` (now 100 entries)
  - Temp file `paper-commented&revised.tmp.md` deleted
  - Removed redundant "sources are given in Section 2" parenthetical (inline citations suffice)
- **Next**: Re-upload arxiv/ to Overleaf, continue arXiv submission + networking outreach

## What Changed This Session (Session 15)

### Paper Revisions (6 changes across paper.md + arxiv/paper.tex)
1. **Section 1.2 intro** — Added "(sources are given in Section 2)" to back the claim that each requirement has been identified in prior literature
2. **Requirements 3-7** — Added inline citations: Boundary Problem (Bayne, 2010; Tononi, 2004), Structure of Experience (Nagel, 1974), Unity and Binding (Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Revonsuo, 1999), Combination and Emergence (Chalmers, 2016), Causal Role (Jackson, 1982)
3. **ISM description** — "no homunculus" → "no unified homunculus" (sub-models act as partial homunculi)
4. **Hard Problem dissolution analogy** — "operating system" → "video game" (OS is too substrate-level; a game better captures the virtual/phenomenal nature)
5. **Triply extended consciousness** — Added: prerequisite for the scientific study of consciousness itself
6. **Free will** — Added nuance: reflecting on free will (triply extended) can alter the substrate's future decision landscape, creating something functionally close to libertarian free will

### BibTeX Addition
- `Treisman1980` (Treisman & Gelade, "A Feature-Integration Theory of Attention", Cognitive Psychology) added to `arxiv/references.bib`

## Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `paper.md` | 6 revisions from author review |
| `arxiv/paper.tex` | Matching 6 revisions in LaTeX |
| `arxiv/references.bib` | Added Treisman1980 entry (now 100 entries) |

## Previous Session (Session 14) Summary
- Networking plan (`networking-plan.md`), LaTeX conversion (`arxiv/`), README hero image swap, outreach emails drafted
- arXiv + Overleaf accounts created

## Remote Config
- `origin` → `JeltzProstetnic/aIware` (public) — ONLY push target
- Session 15 changes NOT yet committed/pushed

## Open TODOs

### Immediate (This Session)
- [ ] User: Create arXiv account (arxiv.org, "Independent" affiliation)
- [ ] User: Create Overleaf account (overleaf.com)
- [ ] Upload `arxiv/` directory to Overleaf, verify compilation
- [ ] Commit and push networking-plan.md, arxiv/, README change

### arXiv-Specific
- [ ] Get endorsement for q-bio.NC (best candidates: Shriki, Hengen, Priesemann)
- [ ] Submit to arXiv once endorsed
- [ ] Cross-list to cs.AI

### Near-term
- [ ] ASSC 29 abstract submission (deadline TBD, submissions open now)
- [ ] ASSC satellite workshop submission (deadline Feb 28)
- [ ] Email ConCrit authors (Shriki/Algom)
- [ ] Email Hengen/Shew
- [ ] Email Metzinger (German)
- [ ] LinkedIn posting with Figure 1 PNG (after arXiv goes live)

### Ongoing
- [ ] Sync private repo
- [ ] Frontiers submission
- [ ] Magazine submissions
- [ ] Book manuscript review

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Session 15 applied 6 author-review revisions to paper.md + arxiv/paper.tex — verify with `git diff`
3. `arxiv/` directory ready for Overleaf (re-upload after revisions)
5. `networking-plan.md` has the full contact strategy
6. Paper has 9 predictions with P1=fMRI signatures
7. Next steps: commit, push, re-upload to Overleaf, continue outreach
