# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-13 (Session 12, end)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Frontiers submission prep — DONE

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session complete, ready for restart
- **Progress**: Paper trimmed, figures created, prediction added, all pushed
- **Next**: Frontiers LaTeX/Word formatting, arXiv, magazine submissions

## What Changed This Session
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `paper.md` | Trimmed to ~12k body words, added Prediction 9 (fMRI signatures), fixed "grid" language, now 9 predictions |
| `conversation-log.md` | Sessions 11 + 12 appended |
| `figures/*.svg` | Three new SVGs: architecture, real/virtual split, phenomenological content |
| `figures/*.md` | Figure spec (architecture) |
| `cover-letter.md` | NEW — targets Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |
| `pop-sci/podcast-script.md` | Fixed "grid" language |
| `pop-sci/video-script.md` | Fixed "grid" language |

## Remote Config
- `origin` → `JeltzProstetnic/aIware` (public) — ONLY push target
- `aIware-private` exists on GitHub (private) — manuscripts in `manuscripts/` dir, pushed via API (no local remote configured — dual-push architecture was broken)

## Open TODOs

### Immediate
- [ ] Format paper for Frontiers LaTeX/Word template
- [ ] Check word count after Prediction 9 addition (may need minor trim)
- [ ] Render SVGs to PDF/PNG for journal submission

### Near-term
- [ ] arXiv posting (check q-bio.NC endorsement requirements)
- [ ] Self-review paper with fresh eyes
- [ ] Magazine submissions
- [ ] LinkedIn post

### Ongoing
- [ ] Book manuscript review
- [ ] Video recording
- [ ] Podcast outreach

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read THIS FILE first
2. Everything is committed and pushed
3. Paper is ready for Frontiers formatting (~12k body words, 9 predictions, 3 figures)
4. Cover letter at `cover-letter.md` targets Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience
5. Private repo manuscripts accessible via GitHub API only (no local backup remote)
