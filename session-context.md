# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 33, complete)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Verify file integrity after auto-compact + reframe README with grand arc

## Current State
- **Active Task**: None — session complete
- **Progress**: All files verified intact, README reframed, literature review saved
- **Pending**: PsyArXiv/bioRxiv preprint posting, manuscript flow review, intelligence paper refinement

## Session 33 — What Happened

### File Integrity Verification — PASSED
Auto-compact occurred mid-session. Verified all files intact:
- `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md`: 1,070 lines, 26,528 words, all 12 chapters in order
- `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md`: 908 lines, 14,591 body words, all sections intact
- `paper/intelligence/paper.md`: 4× "Gruber, submitted" citations + reference entry confirmed
- `README.md`: Bridge diagram present
- Minor note: full paper has 2 "Gruber, forthcoming" citations (not 3) — not corruption, just one fewer inserted than planned

### README Reframe — COMPLETE
Rewrote README to lead with the grand arc connecting both papers:
- **Title**: "The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness" → "From Consciousness to Intelligence: A Unified Theory"
- **Opening**: "One theory. Two papers. A single causal chain..."
- **Dual epigraph**: Consciousness quote + new intelligence counterpart
- **Grand Arc section**: Leads the page with causal chain diagram
- **Two Papers**: Equal partners ("Paper 1 — The Mechanism" / "Paper 2 — The Implication"), not parent + supplemental

### Intelligence Literature Review — SAVED
Background research agent completed 388-line post-2015 literature review.
Saved to: `tmp/intelligence-literature-review-2015-2026.md`
Key findings: Flynn reversal, growth mindset replication crisis, CHC limitations, process ontology (van Geert 2020), Austrian paradox (IQ up, g down), 10 must-cite references.

### Commits This Session
1. `7ab4111` - Session context update
2. `767b2ab` - README reframe: grand arc leads
3. `c6f27f7` - Post-2015 intelligence literature review

## Open Tasks for Next Session
1. **PsyArXiv/bioRxiv preprint posting** — step-by-step guide requested by user (Task #16)
2. **Review manuscript flow/consistency** — full read-through of book-manuscript.md (Task #12)
3. **Intelligence paper refinement** — existing draft + new literature review as ammunition
4. **Add 3rd "Gruber, forthcoming" citation** to full paper (minor)
5. Ongoing: arXiv endorsement, outreach emails, LinkedIn, book Ch. 2 anatomy

## Key File Locations
- **Pop-sci book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md` (26,528 words)
- **Full paper**: `paper/full/four-model-theory-full.md` (14,591 body words)
- **Intelligence paper**: `paper/intelligence/paper.md` (7,858 words, complete draft)
- **Intelligence literature review**: `tmp/intelligence-literature-review-2015-2026.md` (388 lines, NEW)
- **Trimmed LaTeX (SUBMITTED, do NOT modify)**: `paper/trimmed/arxiv/paper.tex`
- **Paper connections analysis**: `tmp/paper-connections-analysis.md`

## Recovery Instructions
1. Session 33 is DONE — README reframed, integrity verified, literature review saved
2. FIRST TASK next session: Guide PsyArXiv/bioRxiv preprint submission (user explicitly requested this)
3. Then: review manuscript flow (Task #12)
4. Intelligence paper: use `tmp/intelligence-literature-review-2015-2026.md` for refinement
5. ALWAYS push to BOTH remotes
