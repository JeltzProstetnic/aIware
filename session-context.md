# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-16 (Session 59)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Handle bioRxiv rejection + NoC formatting issue; get preprints posted; update trimmed paper

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Session 59 in progress
- **Progress**:
  - bioRxiv rejected full paper (scope: not a data paper). Not a merit issue.
  - NoC "unsubmitted" trimmed paper — needs .docx format + highlights file. NOT a rejection.
  - Decided: both papers → PsyArXiv (better scope fit, auto DOIs, 24-72h posting)
  - Prepared metadata for both PsyArXiv submissions (`tmp/psyarxiv-metadata.md`)
  - **User submitted both papers to PsyArXiv** — awaiting moderation (24-72h)
  - Updated trimmed paper with ~30 improvements from full paper version:
    - Better abstract (framing + decade-apart convergence)
    - Improved Section 1 (Friston citation, Lamme 2010, COGITATE detail, humility statement, roadmap)
    - Better Section 2 (expanded 2.1/2.2/2.4/2.5/2.6 with examples, James/Goff citations)
    - Section 3 improvements (Graziano 2024, two-level ontology clarity, leak examples, Meta-Problem prediction)
    - Section 4 upgrades (dual evaluation architecture, TC2 simulation-must-feel, quantum footnote, six-layer argument)
    - Added blindsight + Anton's double dissociation to Section 6.6
    - Section 7 transparency (assessment criteria, COGITATE fix, MGH description)
    - Rewrote Section 10.3 limitations (nuanced causal status, Godel, modeling error)
    - Fixed conclusion (causal role wording, intelligence cross-reference)
    - Professional acknowledgments rewrite + Data Availability + Funding statements
    - Added 15 new references

## Remaining Work THIS SESSION
- ~~Update GitHub README~~ DONE
- ~~Update MEMORY.md~~ DONE
- ~~Append conversation log~~ DONE
- **Commit + push** to both remotes — IN PROGRESS

## Project State
- **Trimmed paper**: UNSUBMITTED from NoC (formatting). Updated with full-paper improvements. Needs .docx + highlights for resubmission.
- **Full paper**: bioRxiv REJECTED (scope). Submitted to PsyArXiv, awaiting moderation.
- **Intelligence paper**: Submitted to PsyArXiv, awaiting moderation.
- **Outreach emails**: 2 sent (Hengen + Shriki). Remaining drafts not sent.
- **Book**: ~48,200 words. Free manuscript on GitHub. Print/ebook early summer 2026.

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read this file
2. Both PsyArXiv submissions pending moderation (24-72h from 2026-02-16)
3. Next: Update README, commit, push. Then .docx conversion + highlights for NoC resubmission.
4. Do NOT resubmit to NoC until PsyArXiv preprints are live (can add preprint DOIs to submission)

## Conversation Summary
Session 59: Handled two setbacks — bioRxiv rejection (scope, not merit) and NoC unsubmission (formatting). Decided both papers → PsyArXiv. Prepared metadata, user submitted both. Then systematically updated trimmed paper with ~30 improvements from the full paper version (better arguments, more citations, professional acknowledgments, data/funding statements). All changes applied to canonical .md. Ready for README update and commit.
