# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-15 (Session 37, ongoing)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Open todos review, book PDF generation, first read-through feedback

## Current State
- **Active Task**: Collecting book manuscript feedback from first PDF read-through
- **Progress**:
  - Reviewed all open todos
  - bioRxiv chosen over arXiv (user withdrawing arXiv submission, submitting to bioRxiv)
  - Generated 124-page A5 book PDF with 3 figures
  - Collected 41 feedback items from first read-through (through Ch 7)
  - All feedback logged in `tmp/book-feedback-session37.md` and committed after each item
- **Pending**: User still reading (was at Ch 7 clinical section). More feedback expected.

## Session 37 — Key Decisions
1. **bioRxiv over arXiv** — no endorsement wall, 24-72hr turnaround. arXiv endorsement contacts (Hengen, Shriki) still useful for future papers.
2. **C4CA** = persistent shorthand for Class 4 Cellular Automaton (added to MEMORY.md)
3. **Gruber 5-class scheme** — Monotonous, Periodic, Fractal, Interesting, Chaotic (or collapsed to 4 by merging Monotonous into Periodic). Evaluate on merit, not fidelity to German book.
4. **Neurology appendix** — structural decision, move all neuro terminology to appendix chapter
5. **"Good" not "right"** — theory is a model, maintain epistemic humility throughout

## Feedback Summary (41 items in tmp/book-feedback-session37.md)
Key themes:
- **Tone/voice**: More authentic, less academic (wobbly table joke, cut "exactly right", etc.)
- **Figures needed**: Simple bubble diagram, five-layer stack, simple real/virtual split, Game of Life panels, Stable Diffusion illustration for Ch 3 climax
- **Theoretical corrections**: Optical illusions always-model, permeability leaks not "never", confabulation not clean breaks, concentrate→relax
- **Safety**: Psychedelics warnings (ruin lives, schizophrenia, salvia deaths, other drugs destroy neurons, meditation/lucid dreaming as safe alternatives)
- **Structural**: Neurology appendix, CBT mechanistic justification, blindsight/Anton's more prominent
- **Classification**: Gruber 5-class (or 4-class) replacing Wolfram, hologram-automaton relationship reordering

## Key File Locations
- **Feedback log**: `tmp/book-feedback-session37.md` (41 items)
- **Book PDF**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.pdf` + `C:\Users\Matthias\Desktop\book-manuscript.pdf`
- **PDF converter**: `tmp/build_book_pdf.py` (needs table support fix)
- **Book manuscript**: `pop-sci/book-manuscript.md`

## Recovery Instructions
1. Read `tmp/book-feedback-session37.md` for all 41 feedback items
2. User may still be reading — expect more feedback
3. Do NOT apply edits yet — collecting only
4. Conversation log entry still needed before session end
5. All commits pushed to both remotes through feedback #41
