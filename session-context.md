# Session Context — aIware

## Session Info
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-22T12:10Z (Session 100)
- **Working Directory**: /home/jeltz/aIware
- **Session Goal**: Gmail setup, Biyu He email, massive outreach research, ASSC 29 abstract

## What Was Done This Session
1. **Gmail MCP access confirmed** — authenticated via OAuth with `jeltz.prostetnic@gmail.com` (NOT matthias@matthiasgruber.com — no Google login for that). Send-as alias works for matthias@.
2. **Checked last 10 sent emails** — confirmed 3 researcher emails (Stark, Nilsen, Shevlin), 3 podcast pitches (Narabo bounced, TOE, Wendland), 3 press pitches (VN, Standard, scinexx), 1 Kindle convert
3. **Drafted and sent email to Biyu J. He** (NYU, Perception & Brain Dynamics Lab) — key contact, has 7T fMRI/MEG/ECoG infrastructure to test FMT predictions. Email at `tmp/email-biyu-he.txt`
4. **Learned neuroscience communication rule** from Matthias's corrections: never enumerate fixed model counts ("four models") to neuroscientists — say "two kinds of models" or "model kinds". Saved as permanent rule in MEMORY.md.
5. **Console output rule** saved: never paste >10 words for copy-paste. Use tmp files + Notepad instead.
6. **Massive outreach research** — 3 parallel Opus agents produced:
   - 17 new researcher targets (topped by COGITATE cluster: Melloni, Mudrik, Peters)
   - 13 media/podcast targets (Robinson's Podcast, Mind Chat, Brain Inspired, Spektrum, etc.)
   - Full 2026 conference calendar with deadlines
   - **ALL compiled into `tmp/outreach-master-list-2026.md`** — opened in Notepad for user
7. **Found ASSC submission instructions PDF**: https://theassc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ASSC-submission-instruction.pdf — NOT YET FETCHED
