**From a theory of consciousness to an architecture for artificial minds.**

---

## What is this?

A systematic attempt to do what the field of consciousness studies has not yet done: take a single, complete theory of consciousness, stress-test it against every major objection, formalize it in a peer-reviewed paper, then *build it*.

The theory is Matthias Gruber's four-model architecture of consciousness, originally published in *Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins* (2023). It synthesizes Daniel Dennett's Multiple Drafts Model, Thomas Metzinger's Self-Model Theory, and neural network architecture into a unified framework that dissolves the hard problem of consciousness.

## The core idea

Consciousness is not a thing the brain *has*. It is a thing the brain *does*: it runs a real-time self-simulation.

The theory identifies four nested models:

| Model | Scope | Mode | Role |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| **Metamodell** | Everything | Implicit/learned | The substrate's total knowledge |
| **Selbstmodell** | Self only | Implicit/learned | The substrate's self-knowledge |
| **Weltmodell** | Everything | Explicit/simulated | The conscious world — what you *experience* |
| **Ich-Modell** | Self only | Explicit/simulated | The conscious self — who you *are* |

The key insight: there are two ontological levels.

- **Real side** (Metamodell + Selbstmodell): physical, learned, implicit. No experience. Lights off.
- **Virtual side** (Weltmodell + Ich-Modell): simulated, explicit, phenomenal. This is where experience lives.

Qualia are not mysterious properties of physical matter. They are the virtual "sixth sense" of the simulation — the way the simulated self perceives its own states. Asking why physical processes feel like something is a category error. The physical processes *don't* feel. The simulation does.

This dissolves the hard problem. It doesn't explain it away (illusionism) or punt it to fundamental physics (panpsychism). It relocates it: experience is constitutively virtual, and within the simulation, qualia are simply what self-perception produces.

## The roadmap

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Theory extraction and formalization | Done |
| Deep challenge round (10 challenges) | **In progress** — 4/10 closed |
| Scientific paper (journal-ready) | Upcoming |
| Popular science article (accessible) | Upcoming |
| AC architecture design | Upcoming |
| Implementation | Upcoming |

### Challenges closed so far

1. **Simulation Subject Problem** — What makes *this* simulation have a subject? *Answer: functional identity + virtual qualia + zombie reductio.*
2. **Ontological Status** — What kind of thing is a virtual quale? *Answer: process physicalism, weak emergence, epiphenomenalism.*
3. **Passive Experience** — Why consciousness during no-override states? *Answer: rest state of the mechanism; consciousness is what it's like to BE the idle system.*
4. **Binding Mechanism** — What unifies the Weltmodell into a coherent frame? *Answer: critical dynamics (Class 4 / edge of chaos). Independent convergence with ConCrit framework — arrived at theoretically without knowledge of the empirical program.*

### Challenges remaining

5. Dreams — dissociation of consciousness from override
6. Psychedelics — less self-model yet MORE consciousness?
7. Anesthesia & disorders — specific architectural failures
8. Split-brain — one or two sets of four models?
9. Predictions — novel testable predictions vs competitors
10. Animal consciousness — where does the theory draw the line?

## Why this matters

The field of consciousness studies is in a pre-paradigm state. After decades of work:
- IIT and GNW both failed full confirmation in the COGITATE adversarial collaboration (Nature, 2025)
- No theory passes all eight requirements for a complete solution
- 124 scholars signed an open letter calling IIT "pseudoscience"
- Cambridge declared in December 2025 that we "may never be able to tell" if AI becomes conscious

Meanwhile, AI systems grow more capable by the month, and the question of machine consciousness has moved from philosophy seminar to corporate policy (Anthropic assigns 0.15–15% probability that Claude is conscious and has a Model Welfare program).

Gruber's theory offers something the field lacks: a complete, substrate-independent architecture with clear functional requirements. If the theory survives the challenge round, it provides a concrete blueprint for artificial consciousness — not as speculation, but as engineering.
