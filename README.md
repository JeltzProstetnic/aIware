# The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness

**A theory that dissolves the hard problem, predicts what you'll become on salvia, and provides a blueprint for artificial consciousness.**

> *Consciousness is not a thing the brain has. It is a thing the brain does: it runs a real-time self-simulation. Qualia are not mysterious properties of physical matter — they are the virtual "sixth sense" of the simulation. The physical processes don't feel. The simulation does.*

## The Paper

**[The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness: A Simulation-Based Framework Unifying the Hard Problem, Binding, and Altered States](paper/full/arxiv/paper.pdf)** (~18,000 words)

A journal-ready scientific paper presenting the complete theory, systematic comparison against IIT/GNW/HOT/PP/AST/RPT, and nine novel testable predictions. Key highlights:

- **Dissolves the Hard Problem** through a two-level ontology (real substrate / virtual simulation) without panpsychism, strong emergence, or illusionism
- **8 for 8** on the requirements any complete theory of consciousness must meet
- **9 novel predictions**, including two few competing theories generate:
  - During psychedelic ego dissolution, what you "become" tracks dominant sensory input — control the input, control the identity
  - Psychedelics should alleviate anosognosia (unawareness of paralysis after stroke) — a cross-domain surprise prediction
- **Theoretical convergence**: The theory's criticality requirement, derived from Wolfram's framework in 2015, converges with the empirical ConCrit framework (140 datasets, 2025-2026)

## The Theory in 60 Seconds

Your brain builds four models:

| Model | What it covers | How it works | Experience? |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Implicit World Model** (IWM) | Everything | Learned, in synaptic weights | No |
| **Implicit Self Model** (ISM) | You | Learned, in synaptic weights | No |
| **Explicit World Model** (EWM) | Everything | Real-time simulation | **Yes — the world you see** |
| **Explicit Self Model** (ESM) | You | Real-time simulation | **Yes — the "I" you are** |

![Four-Model Architecture](figures/figure1-four-model-architecture.svg)

*Figure 1. The four-model architecture showing the relationship between implicit (learned) and explicit (simulated) representations of world and self.*

The first two are the **real side** — physical, structural, lights off. The last two are the **virtual side** — simulated, transient, lights on. Experience lives in the virtual side. Qualia are what the virtual self (ESM) perceives within the virtual world (EWM).

The hard problem asks: "Why does physical processing feel like something?" Answer: **It doesn't.** The physical processing runs in the dark. The *simulation* feels, and within the simulation, feeling is not something added — it's what self-perception *is*.

*Figure 2. The ontological split between the real substrate (physical processing) and the virtual phenomenal world (simulated experience).*

One more requirement: the substrate must operate at the **edge of chaos** (Wolfram's Class 4 regime). Below that → no consciousness (deep sleep, anesthesia). At it → consciousness. Past it → chaos (seizure).

From these pieces — four models, real/virtual split, criticality — you can derive psychedelic phenomenology, anesthesia, dreams, split-brain, DID, animal consciousness, and more. Five principles, fifteen phenomena.

## The 10 Challenges — All Closed

The theory survived a structured adversarial stress test covering every major objection in the consciousness literature:

1. **Simulation Subject Problem** — Virtual qualia + functional identity + zombie reductio
2. **Ontological Status** — Process physicalism, weak emergence, epiphenomenalism
3. **Passive Experience** — Rest state of the mechanism
4. **Binding** — Critical dynamics (Class 4). Independent convergence with ConCrit
5. **Dreams** — Degraded mode at criticality. Lucid dreaming as ESM toggle
6. **Psychedelics** — Redirectable ESM. Salvia as smoking gun. Permeability gradient
7. **Anesthesia & Disorders** — Criticality threshold + model forking (DID)
8. **Split-Brain** — Holographic cloning, not halving
9. **Predictions** — 9 novel, testable, distinguishing
10. **Animal Consciousness** — Gradient, not line. Corvids predicted conscious

## Background

The theory was originally published in German as [*Die Emergenz des Bewusstseins*](https://www.amazon.com/Emergenz-Bewusstseins-German-Matthias-Gruber/dp/1326652079) (Gruber, 2015). That book sold zero copies. It was too long, too dense, and in the wrong language. This project exists to fix that: validate the theory rigorously, publish it accessibly, and eventually build the thing it describes.
