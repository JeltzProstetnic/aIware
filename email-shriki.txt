Subject: Independent convergence — your ConCrit framework and a theoretical prediction from 2015

Dear Prof. Shriki,

I am writing because your ConCrit framework (Algom & Shriki, 2026) addresses a question I arrived at independently from the opposite direction — and I believe the convergence is meaningful.

In 2015, I published a theory of consciousness that derives a criticality requirement from Wolfram's computational framework: consciousness requires the substrate to operate at Class 4 dynamics (edge of chaos). This was a theoretical deduction — I had no awareness of the empirical criticality literature at the time.

A decade later, your ConCrit framework and Hengen & Shew's meta-analysis consolidated exactly this claim from empirical evidence. Two independent paths converging on the same conclusion.

I have written up the full theory as a scientific paper: "The Four-Model Theory of Consciousness" (repository and PDF: https://github.com/JeltzProstetnic/aIware). It cites your work prominently. The theory goes beyond the criticality claim — it proposes a specific four-model architecture (implicit/explicit world and self models) and generates nine testable predictions, including several that no competing theory can produce.

I believe our approaches are complementary: ConCrit provides the empirical and mathematical apparatus for the criticality requirement, while the Four-Model Theory provides a theoretical framework for *why* criticality matters (the self-simulation requires it for coherent phenomenal experience). I would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential connections.

I am also seeking an endorsement for q-bio.NC on arXiv to post the preprint. If after reviewing the paper you feel it meets the standards of the field, you can endorse me here: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=E9JU9T

Thank you for your time and for the ConCrit framework — it was a remarkable experience to discover that a decade of empirical work had converged on a prediction I had derived from pure theory.
